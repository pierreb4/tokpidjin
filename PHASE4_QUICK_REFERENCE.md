# Phase 4 Quick Reference

## What Changed

**Parallelized the scoring loop** in `check_batt` function:

### Before (Sequential)
```python
# Demo samples scored one-by-one
for i, sample in enumerate(demo_task):  # ~12s
    run batt() on sample
    score candidates
    
# Test samples scored one-by-one  
for i, sample in enumerate(test_task):  # ~3s
    run batt() on sample
    score candidates

Total: ~15s sequential
```

### After (Parallel)
```python
# Demo samples scored in parallel
demo_results = await asyncio.gather(*[
    score_demo_sample(i, sample) 
    for i, sample in enumerate(demo_task)
])  # Expected: ~3-4s parallel

# Test samples scored in parallel
test_results = await asyncio.gather(*[
    score_test_sample(i, sample)
    for i, sample in enumerate(test_task)
])  # Expected: ~1-2s (limited by 1 sample)

Total: ~4-6s parallel
```

## Testing

**Command:**
```bash
python run_batt.py --timing -i 007bbfb7 -b tmp_batt_onerun_run
```

**Look for these new metrics:**
```
run_batt.phase4_demo_parallel:  3-4s    (wall-clock time)
run_batt.phase4_demo_cpu:       12-15s  (total CPU time)
run_batt.phase4_test_parallel:  1-2s    (wall-clock time)
run_batt.phase4_test_cpu:       3s      (total CPU time)
```

**Speedup calculation:**
- Demo speedup: `phase4_demo_cpu / phase4_demo_parallel` = 3-4x
- Test speedup: `phase4_test_cpu / phase4_test_parallel` = 1-2x

## Expected Results

### Performance
```
Current (Phase 3):  16.826s total
Expected (Phase 4): 6-10s total

Breakdown:
  - Scoring: 15.5s ‚Üí 4-8s (2-4x faster)
  - Other:   1.3s ‚Üí 1.3s (unchanged)
  
Overall speedup: 2.2-3.6x
```

### Correctness
Should produce identical results:
- Same number of candidates (32 after filtering)
- Same solver scores (o_score values)
- Same differ scores (d_score, s_score values)
- Same files in solver_md5/ and differ_md5/

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Code compiles ‚úÖ (already verified)
- [ ] Runs on Kaggle without errors
- [ ] Produces same candidate count
- [ ] Generates same solver files
- [ ] Shows performance improvement
- [ ] New profiling metrics appear
- [ ] Speedup ratio makes sense (2-4x)

## Complete Optimization Journey

```
Phase 1: Filter + Batch Inline
  21.788s ‚Üí 16.884s (22.5% faster)
  - Candidates: 149 ‚Üí 32
  - Inline: 6x faster

Phase 2: Parallel Validation  
  16.884s ‚Üí 16.826s (validation 19.4x faster!)
  - Validation: 7.1s ‚Üí 0.37s wall-clock
  - Exposed scoring bottleneck

Phase 3: Identify Real Bottleneck
  - Profiled all operations
  - Found: scoring 15.5s (92% of time)
  - Ruled out: file ops fast (0.015s)

Phase 4: Parallel Scoring
  16.826s ‚Üí 6-10s target (2.2-3.6x faster)
  - Demo scoring: 12s ‚Üí 3-4s (parallel)
  - Test scoring: 3s ‚Üí 1-2s (parallel)
  
Total: 21.8s ‚Üí 6-10s (2.2-3.6x overall speedup!)
```

## If Things Go Wrong

### Issue: Less speedup than expected
- Check individual sample times in profiling
- Look for resource contention
- Consider CPU vs I/O bound operations

### Issue: Incorrect results
- Compare candidate counts before/after
- Check o_score, d_score values match
- Verify file counts in solver_md5/

### Issue: Errors during execution
- Check asyncio.gather error messages
- Verify timeout handling works
- Look for race conditions in aggregation

## Files Modified

- **run_batt.py**: 
  - Added `score_demo_sample()` async function
  - Added `score_test_sample()` async function
  - Replaced sequential loops with `asyncio.gather()`
  - Added Phase 4 profiling metrics
