# Pipeline Performance at Scale - Oct 15, 2025

## Critical Context: Production Scale

### Current Testing
- **Task count**: 32 tasks
- **Samples per task**: ~3-5 (varied)
- **Total samples**: ~100-160
- **Solver baseline**: 5.3ms/sample × ~130 samples = **0.7 seconds**

### Production Target
- **Task count**: 400 tasks
- **Samples per task**: 3-12 (avg ~7.5)
- **Total samples**: ~3,000
- **Solver baseline**: 5.3ms/sample × 3,000 samples = **15.9 seconds**

### Scale Factor
- **30x more tasks** (32 → 400)
- **23x more samples** (~130 → 3,000)

**Key Insight:** GPU acceleration ROI increases **dramatically** at production scale!

## GPU Acceleration ROI by Scale

### Current Scale (32 tasks, ~130 samples)

| Optimization | Speedup | Time Saved | ROI |
|--------------|---------|------------|-----|
| None (CPU baseline) | 1.0x | 0s | - |
| GPU DSL (2-6x) | 2-6x | 0.5-0.6s | Low |
| Batch ops (10-35x) | 10-35x | 0.6-0.7s | Low |
| **Both combined** | ~15-50x | **0.6-0.7s** | **Low** |

**Conclusion at current scale:** Not worth the effort (~0.6s saved)

### Production Scale (400 tasks, ~3,000 samples)

| Optimization | Speedup | Time Saved | ROI |
|--------------|---------|------------|-----|
| None (CPU baseline) | 1.0x | 0s (15.9s total) | - |
| GPU DSL (2-6x) | 2-6x | **10-13s** | **High** |
| Batch ops (10-35x) | 10-35x | **14-15.4s** | **Very High** |
| **Both combined** | ~15-50x | **14.5-15.5s** | **Excellent** |

**Conclusion at production scale:** **Definitely worth it!** (10-15s saved = 63-97% faster)

## Performance Projections

### Scenario 1: CPU Only (Current)
```
400 tasks × 7.5 samples/task × 5.3ms/sample = 15,900ms = 15.9 seconds
```
**Plus overhead (unknown)**: Generation, validation, I/O

### Scenario 2: GPU DSL Only (Week 1-4 Implementation)
```
400 tasks × 7.5 samples/task × 2.0ms/sample = 6,000ms = 6.0 seconds (2.7x)
400 tasks × 7.5 samples/task × 0.9ms/sample = 2,700ms = 2.7 seconds (5.9x)
```
**Speedup**: 2-6x on solver execution = **9.9-13.2 seconds saved**

### Scenario 3: Batch Operations Only (Integrate Existing)
```
3,000 samples in batches of 200 = 15 batches
15 batches × ~50ms/batch = 750ms = 0.75 seconds (21x)
```
**Speedup**: 10-35x on batched operations = **14-15.4 seconds saved**

### Scenario 4: Both GPU DSL + Batch Ops (Optimal)
```
3,000 samples in batches of 200 with GPU DSL operations
Expected: 10-35x batch speedup × 2-6x DSL speedup = 20-210x combined
Realistic: ~30-50x combined (accounting for overhead)

15.9s / 40x = ~400ms = 0.4 seconds
```
**Speedup**: ~30-50x combined = **14.5-15.5 seconds saved**

## Time Budget Analysis

### Kaggle Competition Constraints
- **Total time limit**: 9 hours (32,400 seconds)
- **Per submission**: Unlimited in time limit

### Current Pipeline (CPU)
```
Generation time:     ??? (need profiling)
Solver execution:    15.9s (at 400 tasks)
Validation:          ??? (need profiling)
I/O:                 ??? (need profiling)
---
TOTAL:               ??? + 15.9s
```

### With GPU Optimization
```
Generation time:     ??? (same)
Solver execution:    0.4-6.0s (15-40x faster)
Validation:          ??? (same)
I/O:                 ??? (same)
---
TOTAL:               ??? + 0.4-6.0s
SAVED:               9.9-15.5 seconds
```

### ROI Assessment

**If solver execution is 50% of total time:**
- Current: 31.8s total → With GPU: 16-22s total
- **Speedup: 1.4-2.0x overall** (worth it!)

**If solver execution is 25% of total time:**
- Current: 63.6s total → With GPU: 48-58s total
- **Speedup: 1.1-1.3x overall** (marginal)

**If solver execution is 10% of total time:**
- Current: 159s total → With GPU: 143-154s total
- **Speedup: 1.0-1.1x overall** (not worth it)

**Need to profile full pipeline to determine solver % of total time!**

## Optimization Strategy

### Phase 1: Profile Current Pipeline ✅ IN PROGRESS
```bash
bash run_card.sh -i -b -c -32
```

Measure:
1. **Code generation time** (card.py)
2. **Solver execution time** (run_batt.py) ← We know: ~0.7s for 32 tasks
3. **Validation time**
4. **I/O time**
5. **Total time**

Calculate:
- Solver % of total time
- Bottleneck identification
- Optimization priority

### Phase 2: Quick Wins (If Applicable)
- Optimize I/O (caching, buffering)
- Optimize validation (vectorize checks)
- Optimize generation (code caching)

**Goal**: Eliminate non-solver bottlenecks first

### Phase 3: Batch Operations Integration 🎯 HIGH PRIORITY
**Why this first:**
- ✅ Code already exists and validated (gpu_optimizations.py)
- ✅ 10-35x speedup proven on Kaggle T4x2
- ✅ Medium effort (connect existing pieces)
- ✅ Works for current scale AND production scale
- ✅ No risk (CPU fallback built-in)

**Implementation:**
1. Instantiate `GPUBatchProcessor` in run_batt.py
2. Route sample processing through batch operations
3. Test on 32 tasks (expect 0.02-0.07s vs 0.7s)
4. Scale to 400 tasks (expect 0.75s vs 15.9s)

**Expected ROI at 400 tasks: 14-15 seconds saved**

### Phase 4: GPU DSL Operations 🎯 MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Why this second:**
- ❌ Code doesn't exist (need to implement)
- ✅ 2-6x speedup expected
- ❌ High effort (coding, testing, validation)
- ✅ Complements batch operations
- ⚠️ Some risk (need to ensure correctness)

**Implementation:**
1. Implement gpu_o_g with hybrid CPU/GPU selection
2. Add 70-cell threshold logic
3. Test correctness on all solvers
4. Validate speedup on Kaggle
5. Convert 20-50 high-value solvers

**Expected ROI at 400 tasks: Additional 2-4 seconds saved**

### Phase 5: Combined Optimization 🎯 OPTIMAL
**Batch ops + GPU DSL:**
- Best of both worlds
- 30-50x combined speedup
- 15.9s → 0.4-0.8s

This enables production-scale evaluation that was previously impractical! 🚀
