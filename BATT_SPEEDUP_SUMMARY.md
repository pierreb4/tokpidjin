# 🚀 Batt Speedup Success Summary

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Hardware:** Kaggle L4x4 (4× L4 GPUs)  
**Status:** ✅ Phase 1 Complete, 22.5% Speedup Achieved

---

## 📊 Quick Results

### Before → After:
- **Total Time:** 21.788s → 16.884s (**22.5% faster**)
- **Candidates:** 149 → 32 (**78% reduction**)
- **inline_variables:** 3.645s → 1.552s (**2.4x faster**)
- **Batch inline phase:** 3.645s → 0.599s (**6x faster**)

### Key Message:
**"We filtered 149 candidates down to 32 unique ones and processed them 6x faster!"** 🎉

---

## 🎯 What We Did (Phase 1)

### 1. **Early Duplicate Filtering** ⚡
```python
# Compute cheap body hash BEFORE expensive inline_variables
body_hash = md5(solver_body)
if body_hash in seen_bodies:
    skip  # Don't waste time on duplicates!
```
**Result:** 149 → 32 candidates (78% reduction)

### 2. **Batch Parallel Inlining** ⚡⚡
```python
# OLD: Sequential processing
for candidate in all_o:
    inline_variables(candidate)  # Slow!

# NEW: Parallel processing  
with ThreadPoolExecutor(4) as executor:
    executor.map(inline_one, candidates)  # Fast!
```
**Result:** 3.645s → 0.599s in batch phase (6x speedup)

### 3. **Enhanced Profiling** 📊
Added phase breakdown:
- Phase 1: Filter (0.015s)
- Phase 2: Batch inline (0.599s)
- Phase 3: Process (0.633s + validation)
- Phase 4: Differs (0.005s)

## 🔍 New Bottleneck Discovered

**check_solver_speed() takes ~14s** (validation)
- 32 solvers × 6 samples = 192 executions
- Sequential (not parallelized yet)
- **This is the next optimization target!**

Expected additional gain: **3-4x** (14s → 3.5s)  
Total potential: **21.8s → 6-8s** (2.7-3.6x overall)

## 🧪 How to Test

### On Kaggle:
```bash
python run_batt.py --timing -i 007bbfb7 -b tmp_batt_onerun_run
```

### Look for these metrics:
```
Timing summary (seconds):
  main.run_batt                   16.884  ← Total time
  run_batt.check_batt             15.635
  run_batt.phase1_filter           0.015  ← Fast!
  run_batt.phase2_inline_batch     0.599  ← 6x speedup
  run_batt.phase3_process          0.633
  run_batt.phase4_differs          0.005  ← Fast!
  run_batt.check_solver_speed    ~14.000  ← Next target
  utils.inline_variables.total     1.552  ← 2.4x faster
```

And the message:
```
-- Filtered to 32 unique candidates (from 149)
```

## 💡 Next Steps (Phase 2)

### Option A: Parallel Validation (Recommended) ⚡⚡
**Implementation:** Use `asyncio.gather()` to validate all 32 solvers in parallel  
**Expected gain:** 14s → 3.5s (4x speedup on validation)  
**Total result:** 16.9s → **6-8s** (2-3x overall)  
**Risk:** Low  
**Effort:** 30 minutes  
**Code:** See `next_optimization.py`

### Option B: Validation Caching ⚡⚡⚡
**Implementation:** Cache validated solver hashes, skip re-validation  
**Expected gain:** 14s → ~0s for known solvers  
**Risk:** Medium (need good cache invalidation)  
**Effort:** 2 hours

### Option C: Both A + B ⚡⚡⚡⚡
**Expected result:** 21.8s → **3-5s** (4-7x total speedup!)

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Profile first!** - We found the real bottleneck (inline_variables called 149 times)
2. **Filter early!** - 78% reduction with cheap body-hash check
3. **Batch parallelize!** - 6x speedup on expensive operations
4. **Measure phases!** - Clear visibility into what's slow
5. **Sequential validation is expensive!** - Next target identified
