# ⚠️ PHASE 2A VALIDATION - ISSUE: ONLY 1 TASK PROCESSED

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Status**: ❌ **INCOMPLETE RUN - WRONG TASK COUNT**  
**Expected**: 100 tasks  
**Actual**: 1 task  
**Wall-clock**: 1.096s (single task only)

---

## What Happened

### Command Run
```bash
python run_batt.py -c 100 --cprofile --cprofile-top 30
```

### Expected
- 100 tasks processed
- ~13,200 solvers generated
- Wall-clock: 3.08-3.15s
- Duration: ~80-100s with profiler

### What Actually Ran
- **Only 1 task processed** ❌
- 32 solvers generated (from 1 task)
- Wall-clock: 1.096s
- 1 timeout

### Evidence
```
run_batt.py:1481: -- Filtered to 32 unique candidates (from 100)
1 tasks - 1 timeouts           ← ONLY 1 TASK
```

---

## Why This Happened

**Possible Causes**:

1. **Task selection issue**: run_batt.py might have failed to select 100 tasks
2. **Timeout or crash**: Process might have exited after first task
3. **Task availability**: Might not have 100 tasks available
4. **Previous run interference**: card.py run might have affected state

### Evidence Supporting Each

**Task availability**:
- card.py output: `len(all_solvers) = 323` (323 solvers available)
- run_batt processed: Only 1 task

**Timeout**:
- Output shows: `1 tasks - 1 timeouts`
- Suggests first task timed out and process ended

---

## What This Means

### ✅ Good News
- Code still compiles and runs
- No crashes
- GPU still working
- Cache still functioning (77.5% hit rate)
- Framework overhead: ~65% (correct for larger tasks)

### ❌ Bad News
- **Didn't measure Phase 2a impact** - only 1 task
- **No meaningful per-function data** - objects() still not visible in top 30
- **Wall-clock time not comparable** - 1.096s vs 3.23s baseline (different scale)
- **DSL functions still invisible** - same as single-task issue

---

## Analysis of 1-Task Results (1.096s)

### Framework Breakdown
```
asyncio overhead:    ~70% (~0.77s)  - Framework
Threading locks:     ~20% (~0.22s)  - Synchronization
Solver expansion:    ~5%  (~0.06s)  - Code generation
DSL operations:      ~5%  (~0.05s)  - Still not visible
```

**Observation**: Threading locks took 0.229s (significant!) - suggests thread pool contention

---

## Why We Need Another Run

**To get actual 100-task results**, we need:

1. **Verify task count**: Confirm 100 tasks are available
2. **Check for timeouts**: Previous task might have timed out
3. **Run again**: Retry the 100-task validation
4. **Monitor**: Watch for completion

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate: Diagnose Why Only 1 Task

**Check available tasks**:
```bash
ls solver_dir | wc -l      # Count available solver directories
```

**Check what happened**:
```bash
python run_batt.py -c 10 --timing   # Try smaller run first
```

**Check for errors**:
```bash
python run_batt.py -c 100 -t 30 --timing   # Increase timeout
```

### Option 1: Retry with Same Command
```bash
python run_batt.py -c 100 --cprofile --cprofile-top 30
```

### Option 2: Debug First
```bash
# Check what tasks are available
python -c "import os; print('Available tasks:', len(os.listdir('solver_dir')))"

# Try smaller run
python run_batt.py -c 10 --timing
```

### Option 3: Different Approach
```bash
# Without profiler (faster, clearer wall-clock)
python run_batt.py -c 100 --timing

# Or just run batt (no profiler overhead)
python run_batt.py -c 100
```

## Comparison: Single Task vs Expected 100 Tasks

| Metric | 1 Task (Actual) | 100 Tasks (Expected) |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Wall-clock | 1.096s | 3.08-3.15s |
| Solvers | 32 | 13,200 |
| objects() calls | ~40 | ~3,400 |
| objects() visibility | ❌ Not in top 30 | ✅ Top 10-15 |
| Framework % | 70% | 65% |
| DSL % | 5% | 30-35% |

---

## Success Criteria Assessment

### Current Status (1 task)
```
Wall-clock:        1.096s  (not comparable)
Solvers:           32      (not 13,200 ❌)
Errors:            1       (1 timeout ⚠️)
Success rate:      ~97%    (1 timeout out of ~101)
objects() visible: ❌      (not in top 30)
```

### Needed (100 tasks)
```
Wall-clock:        < 3.23s  (compare with Phase 1b)
Solvers:           13,200   (required)
Errors:            0        (required)
Success rate:      100%     (required)
objects() visible: ✅       (in top 10-15)
```

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Understand Why Only 1 Task
- Check logs for error messages
- Verify solver_dir has tasks
- Check timeout settings
- Look for task filtering issues

### Priority 2: Retry 100-Task Run
- Use clearer command: `python run_batt.py -c 100 --timing`
- Watch output to confirm 100 tasks being processed
- Increase timeout if needed: `python run_batt.py -c 100 -t 15 --timing`

### Priority 3: Validate Results
- Once 100 tasks complete, capture metrics
- Compare wall-clock with 3.23s baseline
- Look for objects() improvement in profiler

---

## What We Can Do Now

### Run Diagnostic
```bash
# Check task availability
ls solver_dir | head -20    # See if tasks exist

# Try smaller validation (10 tasks)
python run_batt.py -c 10 --timing

# Then try full run
python run_batt.py -c 100 --timing
```

### Alternative: Quick Check Without Profiler
```bash
# Just get wall-clock time (no profiler overhead)
python run_batt.py -c 100
```

---

## Summary

**Issue**: Only 1 task processed instead of 100
- Possible cause: Task filtering, timeout, or task availability
- Solution: Retry with diagnostic commands
- Impact: Phase 2a validation incomplete, need to rerun

**Next Action**: 
1. ✅ Check why only 1 task was processed
2. ⏳ Retry 100-task run with verification
3. ⏳ Capture proper metrics for 100 tasks
4. ⏳ Analyze Phase 2a improvement

**Do you want me to:**
- A) Provide exact commands to diagnose the issue?
- B) Suggest a retry strategy for 100-task run?
- C) Both?

**Status**: ⚠️ **VALIDATION INCOMPLETE - NEEDS RERUN WITH 100 TASKS**
