# GPU Batt - Batch Processing Strategy (REVISED)

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Context**: Batt runs 1000s of times across all training/evaluation tasks  
**Status**: 🚀 **GPU BATCH PROCESSING IS HIGHLY VIABLE!**

---

## 🎯 Critical New Information

### Usage Pattern
```python
# Batt will be called for EVERY task in training + evaluation
for task_id in all_tasks:  # ~400 training + ~400 evaluation = 800 tasks
    for sample in task_samples:  # 3-10 samples per task = ~4000 total samples
        batt(task_id, S, sample['input'], sample['output'], log_path)
```

**Total batt() calls**: ~4000-8000 executions!

This completely changes the optimization landscape!

---

## 🚀 Why This Enables GPU Batch Processing

### Problem Before (Single Task)
```
Single task with 5 samples:
- Transfer overhead: 0.2ms × 5 = 1ms
- Compute time: 300ms × 5 = 1500ms
- GPU overhead: negligible (0.07%)
```
**Result**: Marginal benefit

### Opportunity Now (All Tasks)
```
All tasks with ~4000 samples:
- Transfer overhead: One-time batch transfer = 10-50ms
- Compute time (parallel): 300ms × 4000 / (4 GPUs × efficiency) ≈ 30-60s
- GPU overhead: 10-50ms / 30,000ms = 0.17%
```
**Result**: MASSIVE parallelism opportunity!

---

## 💡 Optimal GPU Strategy: Mega-Batch Processing

### Architecture

```python
# BEFORE (Current - Sequential)
results = []
for task_id in all_tasks:
    for sample in samples:
        result = batt(task_id, S, I, O, log)
        results.append(result)
# Time: ~4000 × 0.3s = 1200s (20 minutes)

# AFTER (GPU Mega-Batch)
all_inputs = [(task_id, S, I, O) for task, samples in all_data]
results = gpu_batch_batt(all_inputs, batch_size=1000)
# Time: ~50-100s (2-5x speedup or better!)
```

### Why This Works Now

1. **Amortize Transfer Cost**
   - Single batch transfer for 1000 samples: 50ms
   - Per-sample cost: 0.05ms (negligible!)
   - vs individual transfers: 0.2ms × 1000 = 200ms

2. **True GPU Parallelism**
   - 4 GPUs × 1000 parallel threads = 4000 concurrent executions
   - Execute entire batch in time of slowest sample
   - Sequential dependencies within each batt, but batts are independent!

3. **GPU Memory Efficient**
   - Batch size 1000: ~2-4GB GPU memory
   - Kaggle L4: 22.3GB per GPU × 4 = 89.2GB available
   - Can easily fit 4000+ samples

## 📊 Expected Performance

### Current Performance (Sequential)
```
Single batt call: ~0.3s (from Phase 4B profiling)
4000 total calls: 4000 × 0.3s = 1200s (20 minutes)
With parallelism (5 workers): 1200s / 5 = 240s (4 minutes)
```

### GPU Mega-Batch (Estimated)

#### Conservative Estimate
```
Assumptions:
- 4000 samples total
- L4x4 (4 GPUs)
- 80% GPU efficiency
- 0.3s per batt on CPU

Calculation:
- Effective parallelism: 4 GPUs × 80% = 3.2x
- Sequential base: 1200s
- GPU parallel: 1200s / 3.2 = 375s
- With GPU speedup on heavy ops (1.5x): 375s / 1.5 = 250s

Result: 1200s → 250s (4.8x speedup)
```

#### Optimistic Estimate
```
Assumptions:
- Pre-compile DSL operations
- Optimize GPU kernel utilization
- 90% efficiency

Calculation:
- Effective parallelism: 4 GPUs × 90% = 3.6x
- GPU speedup on operations: 2.5x
- Total: 1200s / (3.6 × 2.5) = 133s

Result: 1200s → 133s (9x speedup!)
```

## 🔧 Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Batt Vectorization (Week 4-5)

#### Step 1: Extract Pure Operations
```python
# Current batt structure
def batt(task_id, S, I, C, log_path):
    try:
        t1 = identity(p_g)
    except:
        t1 = _get_safe_default(identity)
    try:
        t2 = t1(I)
    except:
        t2 = _get_safe_default(t1)
    # ... 1000 more ops ...
```

#### Step 2: Vectorize Safe Operations
```python
# Vectorized for batch
def batt_batch(inputs):  # inputs = [(task_id, S, I, C), ...]
    batch_size = len(inputs)
    
    # Prepare batch data
    I_batch = [inp[2] for inp in inputs]
    
    # Vectorized operations (can run on GPU)
    t1_batch = vectorized_identity(p_g_batch)
    t2_batch = vectorized_apply(t1_batch, I_batch)
    
    # Handle exceptions in batch
    t2_batch = handle_batch_failures(t2_batch, _get_safe_default)
    
    return results_batch
```

#### Step 3: GPU Kernel Compilation
```python
# Use CuPy's JIT compilation
@cp.fuse()
def batt_kernel(I_batch, S_batch, params):
    # Fused GPU kernel for common operation sequences
    t1 = identity_gpu(p_g)
    t2 = apply_gpu(t1, I_batch)
    # ... optimized GPU code ...
    return results
```

### Phase 2: Hybrid Execution (Week 6)

```python
def mega_batch_batt(all_inputs, batch_size=1000):
    results = []
    
    for batch_start in range(0, len(all_inputs), batch_size):
        batch = all_inputs[batch_start:batch_start + batch_size]
        
        # Decide GPU vs CPU
        if should_use_gpu(batch):
            batch_results = gpu_batch_batt(batch)
        else:
            batch_results = cpu_batch_batt(batch)
        
        results.extend(batch_results)
    
    return results
```

### Phase 3: Try/Except Handling

**Option A: Pre-validation**
```python
# Check types before GPU batch
valid_mask = validate_batch_types(inputs)
gpu_inputs = inputs[valid_mask]
failed_inputs = inputs[~valid_mask]

# GPU process valid ones
gpu_results = gpu_batch_batt(gpu_inputs)

# CPU fallback for failed
cpu_results = [_get_safe_default(op) for _ in failed_inputs]

# Merge results
results = merge_with_mask(gpu_results, cpu_results, valid_mask)
```

**Option B: Error Flags**
```python
# GPU returns success flags
results, success_flags = gpu_batch_batt(inputs)

# CPU fallback for failures
for i, success in enumerate(success_flags):
    if not success:
        results[i] = cpu_fallback_batt(inputs[i])
```

## 📋 Modified Batt Generation

### Current Generation (card.py)
```python
# Generates sequential with try/except
for operation in operations:
    print(f"try:", file=batt_file)
    print(f"    t{n} = {operation}", file=batt_file)
    print(f"except:", file=batt_file)
    print(f"    t{n} = _get_safe_default({func})", file=batt_file)
```

### New Generation (GPU-friendly)
```python
# Generate both sequential AND vectorized versions
def generate_batt_dual(operations):
    # Sequential version (for single calls)
    generate_sequential_batt(operations)
    
    # Vectorized version (for batch calls)
    generate_vectorized_batt(operations)
```

**Sequential version** (keep for single calls):
```python
def batt(task_id, S, I, C, log_path):
    # Current implementation - unchanged
    pass
```

**Vectorized version** (new for batch):
```python
def batt_vectorized(inputs_batch):
    # Batch-friendly version
    # No try/except at operation level
    # Pre-validate types
    # Return results + error flags
    pass
```

## 📊 Expected ROI

### Engineering Effort

- Annual: 1000 runs × 16 min = 16,000 minutes saved = 267 hours

Optimistic (9x):
- 20 minutes → 2.2 minutes (save 17.8 min per full run)
- Annual: 1000 runs × 17.8 min = 17,800 minutes saved = 297 hours
```

**ROI**: 110 hours investment → 267-297 hours saved annually = 2.4-2.7x return!

## 🔍 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Keep Sequential Batt for Single Calls
**Why**: Some use cases need single batt() call
**Solution**: Dual API - batt() and batt_vectorized()

### 2. Remove Try/Except in Vectorized Version
**Why**: GPU can't handle Python exceptions
**Solution**: Pre-validate types, return error flags
**Trade-off**: Slightly different behavior, but acceptable for batch

### 3. Batch Size = 1000
**Why**: Balance GPU memory vs parallelism
**Tuning**: May need adjustment based on profiling

### 4. Hybrid CPU/GPU Execution
**Why**: Small batches don't benefit from GPU
**Threshold**: GPU only if batch_size > 100

---

## 🚨 Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Different Results (Try/Except Removal)
**Mitigation**: 
- Comprehensive validation on training data
- Keep sequential version as ground truth
- Only use vectorized for batch processing

### Risk 2: GPU Memory Overflow
**Mitigation**:
- Dynamic batch size based on available memory
- Chunk large batches into sub-batches
- Monitor GPU memory usage

### Risk 3: Engineering Complexity
**Mitigation**:
- Incremental development (week by week)
- Extensive testing at each phase
- Fall back to CPU if GPU fails

### Risk 4: GPU Not Available
**Mitigation**:
- Automatic CPU fallback
- Works on local dev (CPU only)
- Kaggle provides GPU

## 💡 Critical Insights

### 1. Batch Size Changes Everything
- Single call: GPU overhead >> benefit
- 1000 calls: GPU overhead << benefit
- 4000 calls: GPU is THE solution

### 2. Sequential Within, Parallel Across

- GPU's strength: massive parallel throughput

### 3. Try/Except Can Be Replaced
- For batch processing: pre-validation acceptable
- Keep sequential version for exploratory use
- Different tools for different jobs

### 4. Amortized Transfer Cost
- 1 transfer: expensive
- 1000 transfers: 0.001× cost per item
- Batch transfers are GPU's superpower
