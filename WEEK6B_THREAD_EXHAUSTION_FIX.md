# Week 6B: Thread Exhaustion Fix

**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Issue**: `RuntimeError: can't start new thread` causing script hangs  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

## Problem Summary

Production deployment hitting thread exhaustion errors that **block the script** rather than fail gracefully:

```
Exception in thread ExecutorManagerThread:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/jupyter/.pyenv/versions/3.11.13/lib/python3.11/threading.py", line 1045, in _bootstrap_inner
    self.run()
  File ".../loky/process_executor.py", line 621, in run
    self.add_call_item_to_queue()
  ...
RuntimeError: can't start new thread
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why It Happens

1. **Loky's Internal Threading**: ProcessPoolExecutor (via loky) spawns an `ExecutorManagerThread` when created
2. **Thread Exhaustion**: System already has too many threads (from concurrent processes)
3. **Uncatchable Exception**: RuntimeError happens **inside loky's thread creation**, not in our code
4. **Script Hangs**: Exception occurs before our try-catch blocks, causing indefinite hang

### Why Previous Fixes Didn't Work

- ✅ Multi-level fallback (Process→Thread→Sequential): **Works for memory errors**
- ❌ Exception handling: **Doesn't catch thread creation failures in loky internals**
- ❌ 1-hour timeout: **Too long, masks the problem for 60 minutes**

## Solution: Multi-Pronged Approach

### 1. Preemptive Thread Count Check ⭐ PRIMARY FIX

**Prevent ProcessPoolExecutor creation when system is overloaded**:

```python
import threading

# Check system health before attempting parallel execution
thread_count = threading.active_count()
system_overloaded = thread_count > 50  # Conservative threshold

if system_overloaded:
    print_l(f"-- System overloaded ({thread_count} threads), using sequential processing")
    use_threads = True  # Forces immediate sequential or minimal threading
```

**How It Works**:
- Count active threads before creating executor
- If > 50 threads: Skip ProcessPoolExecutor, use sequential processing
- Prevents loky from even attempting thread creation
- No RuntimeError because we never try to spawn the ExecutorManagerThread

**Threshold Rationale**:
- Normal system: 10-20 threads
- Multiple run_card.sh instances: 30-40 threads  
- > 50 threads: System under stress, avoid parallel execution
- Conservative to err on side of caution

### 2. Tighter Timeout (1 hour → 10 minutes)

**run_card.sh line 149**:
```bash
# OLD: timeout 3600s (1 hour)
timeout 3600s python -u run_batt.py ...

# NEW: timeout 600s (10 minutes)
timeout 600s python -u run_batt.py ...
```

**Why**:
- If thread exhaustion still occurs, fail after 10 minutes instead of 60
- Allows script to restart faster
- 10 minutes is generous for typical task completion

### 3. System-Aware Worker Selection

**Adaptive behavior based on thread count**:

```python
if use_threads:
    executor_class = ThreadPoolExecutor
    max_workers = 1 if system_overloaded else min(sample_count, 3)
else:
    executor_class = ProcessPoolExecutor
    max_workers = min(sample_count, 3)
```

**Behavior**:
- **Normal load** (<50 threads): 
  - Small batches (<4 samples): ThreadPoolExecutor (3 workers)
  - Large batches (≥4 samples): ProcessPoolExecutor (3 workers)
- **High load** (≥50 threads): 
  - ThreadPoolExecutor (1 worker) - minimal threading
  - Skip ProcessPoolExecutor entirely

### 4. Existing Multi-Level Fallback (Still Active)

**Unchanged safety net**:
```
Level 1: ProcessPoolExecutor (3 workers)
  ↓ OSError/MemoryError/RuntimeError
  ↓ gc.collect()
Level 2: ThreadPoolExecutor (1 worker)
  ↓ Any exception
Level 3: Sequential processing
```

**Handles**: Memory exhaustion, resource errors, unexpected failures

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Scenario A: Normal Load (< 50 threads)
```
1. Check thread count: 15 threads ✓
2. Create ProcessPoolExecutor (3 workers) ✓
3. Process samples in parallel ✓
4. Complete successfully
```

### Scenario B: High Load (50-80 threads)
```
1. Check thread count: 65 threads ⚠️
2. Skip ProcessPoolExecutor (system_overloaded=True)
3. Use ThreadPoolExecutor (1 worker) - minimal threading
4. Complete successfully (slower but stable)
```

### Scenario C: Extreme Load (> 80 threads)
```
1. Check thread count: 95 threads ⚠️⚠️
2. Skip ProcessPoolExecutor (system_overloaded=True)
3. Try ThreadPoolExecutor (1 worker)
4. ThreadPoolExecutor fails (too many threads)
5. Fall back to sequential processing ✓
6. Complete successfully (no parallelism but functional)
```

### Scenario D: Timeout Hit (Rare)
```
1. Script hangs unexpectedly
2. Timeout kills process after 10 minutes (not 1 hour)
3. run_card.sh loop restarts
4. System recovers
```

## Testing Validation

### Test 1: Normal Operation
```bash
bash run_card.sh -o -c -32
# Expected: ProcessPoolExecutor used, parallel execution
```

### Test 2: Simulated Load
```bash
# Terminal 1: Create background threads
python -c "import threading, time; [threading.Thread(target=time.sleep, args=(300,)).start() for _ in range(60)]"

# Terminal 2: Run batt
bash run_card.sh -o -c -32
# Expected: "System overloaded (65 threads), using sequential processing"
```

### Test 3: Timeout Behavior
```bash
# If script hangs, should terminate after 10 minutes (not 1 hour)
time bash run_card.sh -o -c -32
# Expected: < 10 minutes if timeout hit
```

## Code Changes Summary

### run_batt.py

**Line 10**: Added `import threading`
```python
import threading
```

**Lines 530-545**: Preemptive thread count check
```python
thread_count = threading.active_count()
system_overloaded = thread_count > 50

if system_overloaded and DO_PRINT:
    print_l(f"-- System overloaded ({thread_count} threads), using sequential processing")

use_threads = sample_count < 4 or system_overloaded
```

**Lines 546-555**: System-aware executor selection
```python
if use_threads:
    executor_class = ThreadPoolExecutor
    max_workers = 1 if system_overloaded else min(sample_count, 3)
else:
    executor_class = ProcessPoolExecutor
    max_workers = min(sample_count, 3)
```

### run_card.sh

**Line 149**: Reduced timeout from 3600s to 600s
```bash
timeout 600s python -u run_batt.py -t $TIMEOUT -c $COUNT \
    -b ${TMPBATT}_run $BATT_GPU_ARGS | tee ${TMPBATT}_run.log
```

## Production Deployment Checklist

- [x] Add thread count check before ProcessPoolExecutor creation
- [x] Reduce timeout from 1 hour to 10 minutes
- [x] Make executor selection system-aware (thread count)
- [x] Test with normal load (< 50 threads)
- [ ] Test with high load (50-80 threads)
- [ ] Test with extreme load (> 80 threads)
- [ ] Monitor thread count patterns in production logs
- [ ] Validate fallback usage frequency
- [ ] Confirm no script hangs > 10 minutes

## Related Issues

- ✅ **Issue #1**: ProcessPoolExecutor batt import → Fixed with dynamic import (commit 6b39fd6)
- ✅ **Issue #2**: Negative count processing → Fixed with conditional logic (commit c10d612)
- ✅ **Issue #3**: Memory exhaustion → Fixed with multi-level fallback (commit cd43316)
- ✅ **Issue #4**: ThreadPoolExecutor MemoryError → Fixed with 1 worker + gc.collect()
- ✅ **Issue #5**: Thread exhaustion blocks script → Fixed with preemptive check + timeout (THIS FIX)

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to production** with thread count monitoring
2. **Collect metrics** on:
   - Thread count distribution (normal, high, extreme)
   - Fallback frequency (Process→Thread→Sequential)
   - System overload detection rate
3. **Tune threshold** if needed (may adjust 50-thread limit based on data)
4. **Document patterns** in production logs
5. **Week 6C**: Move to algorithm optimizations (batt() early termination)

## Technical Notes

### Why 50 Threads?

**Rationale**:
- Linux default: 1024 threads per process (but can be lower)
- Python/loky overhead: ~5-10 threads per ProcessPoolExecutor
- Multiple processes: 4-8 concurrent run_card.sh instances × 10 threads = 40-80 threads
- Conservative threshold: 50 threads (safety margin before exhaustion)

**Tuning Guidance**:
- If **too many sequential fallbacks** (> 30%): Increase threshold to 70-80
- If **still seeing RuntimeError**: Decrease threshold to 30-40
- Monitor `threading.active_count()` in production logs

### Why 10 Minute Timeout?

**Rationale**:
- Typical task: 5-120 seconds (depending on sample count)
- 32 tasks × 10s timeout = 5.3 minutes (with parallelism)
- 10 minutes: 2x safety margin
- Still fast enough to recover if hangs

**Tuning Guidance**:
- If **legitimate runs timing out**: Increase to 15-20 minutes
- If **want faster recovery**: Decrease to 5 minutes (risky for large batches)

## Conclusion

This fix addresses the **root cause** of script hangs by:
1. **Preventing** thread exhaustion (preemptive check)
2. **Detecting** system overload (thread count monitoring)
3. **Adapting** execution strategy (sequential when needed)
4. **Failing fast** if problems occur (10-minute timeout)

Expected result: **Zero script hangs, graceful degradation under load, stable production**.
