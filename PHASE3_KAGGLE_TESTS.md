# Phase 3 Kaggle Validation Checklist

**Status**: Ready to Deploy  
**Commit**: ed356d0a (GPU operations) + 7ce37cef (documentation)  
**Target**: Achieve 2-3x speedup (12-15s wall-clock for 100 tasks)  

---

## Kaggle Test Sequence

### Test 1: Single Task (Correctness Verification)

**Command:**
```bash
python run_batt.py -c 1 --timing
```

**Expected results:**
- ✅ Completes without errors
- ✅ Output matches Phase 2a exactly
- ✅ GPU batch processor logs: `✓ GPU batch processor initialized (batch size: 100)`
- ✅ Wall-clock: ~0.8-1.2s (single task)

**Success criteria:**
- Zero errors
- Correct solver generation
- GPU initialized message appears

**If it fails:**
- Check GPU is available: Look for "GPU 0: Compute 75, Memory: 14.7GB"
- Check CuPy is installed
- Look for GPU batch processor error messages
- Will fallback to CPU automatically

---

### Test 2: 10 Tasks (Batch Processing Verification)

**Command:**
```bash
python run_batt.py -c 10 --timing
```

**Expected results:**
- ✅ All 10 tasks complete
- ✅ Batch processor logs accumulation stats
- ✅ Wall-clock: ~2-3s total
- ✅ GPU operations being called

**Success criteria:**
- All tasks finish successfully
- No regressions from Phase 2a
- Batch stats show accumulation happening

**Look for in output:**
```
GPU batch processor initialized (batch size: 100)
-- Task N batch stats: added=XX processed=XX
```

---

### Test 3: 32 Tasks (Performance Measurement)

**Command:**
```bash
python run_batt.py -c 32 --timing
```

**Expected results:**
- ✅ All 32 tasks complete
- ✅ Wall-clock: 8-12s (vs 8.624s Phase 2a baseline)
- ✅ Speedup should be visible
- ✅ Zero errors

**Success criteria:**
- No regressions
- Speedup observed (even if small at this scale)
- All validation metrics pass

**Performance target for 32-task:**
- Phase 2a: 8.624s
- Phase 3 target: 5-7s (1.2-1.7x speedup)

---

### Test 4: 100 Tasks (Full Validation)

**Command:**
```bash
python run_batt.py -c 100 --timing
```

**Expected results:**
- ✅ All 100 tasks complete
- ✅ **Wall-clock: 12-15s** (vs 24.813s Phase 2a)
- ✅ 2x overall speedup achieved
- ✅ Solvers: 13,200 generated
- ✅ Errors: 0
- ✅ Correctness: 100%

**Critical metrics to compare:**

| Metric | Phase 2a | Phase 3 Target | Status |
|--------|----------|---|---|
| Wall-clock | 24.813s | ≤15s | ✅ Pass if ≤15s |
| Inlining cache | 100% (16k/16k) | Maintained | ✅ Should be 100% |
| Validation cache | 18.0% (576/3200) | ~18% | ✅ Similar expected |
| Errors | 0 | 0 | ✅ Must be 0 |
| Solvers | 13,200 | 13,200 | ✅ Must be same |

**Success criteria:**
- ✅ Wall-clock ≤ 15s (2x improvement)
- ✅ Correctness 100% (matches Phase 2a exactly)
- ✅ Zero errors
- ✅ All 13,200 solvers generated

---

## Analysis & Interpretation

### If Wall-Clock is ≤15s: ✅ SUCCESS

**Expected:**
- 2x overall speedup achieved
- GPU acceleration working perfectly
- Combined optimization: -50% to -60% from baseline

**Next:**
- Document results in PHASE3_RESULTS.md
- Analyze which operations benefited most
- Consider Phase 4 optimizations

### If Wall-Clock is 15-20s: ⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS

**Possible reasons:**
- GPU operations showing 1.2-1.5x speedup (partial benefit)
- Some operations falling back to CPU
- Not all DSL calls being GPU-accelerated yet

**Next:**
- Analyze timing breakdown to identify bottlenecks
- Consider optimizing more operations
- Plan Phase 3b (enhanced GPU operations)

### If Wall-Clock is >20s: ❌ INVESTIGATION NEEDED

**Possible issues:**
- GPU operations failing, falling back to CPU
- GPU transfer overhead not being amortized
- GPU acceleration not being called

**Troubleshooting:**
1. Check if GPU batch processor initialized: `✓ GPU batch processor initialized`
2. Look for GPU error messages: `⚠ GPU batch operation failed`
3. Verify GPU is still available: Check device memory
4. Check CuPy is still working
5. Review error logs for operation-specific failures

**Fallback:**
- Code will automatically fallback to CPU
- System will continue working but without GPU speedup
- Document issue and plan fix

## Detailed Logging (If Needed)

To get more detailed GPU operation logs, you can enable debugging:

**Option 1: Check stderr for GPU messages**
```bash
python run_batt.py -c 100 --timing 2>&1 | grep -i gpu
```

**Option 2: Get timing breakdown**
```bash
python run_batt.py -c 100 --timing 2>&1 | tail -50
```

**Option 3: Check for GPU initialization**
```bash
python run_batt.py -c 1 --timing 2>&1 | head -20
```

## Quick Reference: Expected Timings

### Per-operation GPU speedup

| Operation | CPU | GPU | Speedup |
|-----------|-----|-----|---------|
| rot90 (100 grids) | ~50ms | ~5-10ms | 5-10x |
| flip (100 grids) | ~50ms | ~5-10ms | 5-10x |
| transpose (100 grids) | ~30ms | ~3-8ms | 4-10x |
| shift (100 grids) | ~40ms | ~4-8ms | 5-10x |
| Transfer overhead (100 grids) | N/A | ~0.2ms | Amortized |

### Expected wall-clock improvement

```
100-task run breakdown:

Phase 2a (24.813s):
├─ Solver execution: ~12s
├─ Framework/overhead: ~13s
└─ Total: 24.813s

Phase 3 (target 12-15s):
├─ Solver execution: ~4-6s (3-4x GPU speedup)
├─ Framework/overhead: ~8-9s (minimal improvement)
└─ Total: 12-15s
```

## Commit & Document Results

**After successful 100-task validation:**

1. Create `PHASE3_RESULTS.md` with:
   - Actual wall-clock times achieved
   - Speedup comparison with Phase 2a
   - GPU vs CPU operation statistics
   - Performance analysis

2. Commit results:
```bash
git add PHASE3_RESULTS.md
git commit -m "docs: Phase 3 validation results - GPU acceleration achieved Xs speedup"
```

3. Update overall progress tracking

---

## Timeline & Effort

**Estimated time for full Kaggle validation:**
- Test 1 (1 task): 5 minutes
- Test 2 (10 tasks): 10 minutes
- Test 3 (32 tasks): 15 minutes
- Test 4 (100 tasks): 25 minutes
- Analysis & documentation: 15 minutes
- **Total: ~70 minutes (~1 hour)**

---

## Next Phase Planning

### If Phase 3 Succeeds (Expected)

**Possible Phase 4 directions:**
1. **Framework optimization** - Optimize the 13s framework overhead
2. **Additional GPU operations** - Accelerate more DSL operations
3. **Loop optimization** - Optimize genetic algorithm loops
4. **Memory optimization** - Further reduce overhead

### Combined Optimization Path

```
Phase 1b: -4.7% (Type safety)
Phase 2a: +0% (Cache, amortized)
Phase 3: -45% to -60% (GPU acceleration) ← You are here
Phase 4: -5% to -15% (Additional optimizations)
────────────────────────────────────
Total: -54% to -75% from baseline
```
