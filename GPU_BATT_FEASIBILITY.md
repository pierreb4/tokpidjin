# GPU Acceleration for Batt Function - Feasibility Analysis

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Context**: After achieving 4.06x speedup with CPU optimizations, exploring GPU options

---

## 🎯 Question

Can we run the entire `batt()` function on GPU? It's generated code, so we can modify it.

---

## 📋 Current Batt Structure

### Generated Code Pattern
```python
def batt(task_id, S, I, C, log_path):
    s = []  # Solver scores
    o = []  # Outputs
    
    # Hundreds of sequential operations like:
    try:
        t1 = identity(p_g)
    except (TypeError, AttributeError, ValueError):
        t1 = _get_safe_default(identity)
    
    try:
        t2 = t1(I)
    except (TypeError, AttributeError, ValueError):
        t2 = _get_safe_default(t1)
    
    # ... 500-1000+ more operations ...
    
    s.append((n, 'solver_id', 'differ_hash', tn))
    
    return o, s
```

### Key Characteristics
1. **Sequential dependency chain**: t2 depends on t1, t3 depends on t2, etc.
2. **Try/except blocks**: Every operation wrapped for safety
3. **Mixed operations**: DSL ops, function calls, appends
4. **Dynamic data structures**: Lists (s, o) mutated throughout
5. **Variable length**: Can be 100-4000+ lines depending on task

---

## 🚫 GPU Challenges (Why It's Hard)

### 1. Sequential Dependencies
**Problem**: GPU excels at parallel work, but batt is inherently sequential
```python
t1 = op1()      # Must complete first
t2 = op2(t1)    # Depends on t1
t3 = op3(t2)    # Depends on t2
```
**Impact**: No parallelism opportunity - GPU would run no faster than CPU

### 2. Try/Except Blocks
**Problem**: GPUs don't support Python exception handling
```python
try:
    t1 = o_g(I, R7)
except (TypeError, AttributeError, ValueError):
    t1 = _get_safe_default(o_g)
```
**GPU Reality**: 
- CUDA/CuPy can't catch Python exceptions
- Would need complete rewrite without try/except
- But exceptions are essential for batt's evolutionary approach

### 3. Dynamic Data Structures
**Problem**: GPUs want fixed-size arrays, batt uses dynamic lists
```python
s = []  # Dynamic list
s.append((n, 'solver_id', 'differ_hash', tn))  # Grows unpredictably
```
**GPU Reality**:
- Would need pre-allocated fixed arrays
- Unknown size (depends on successful operations)
- Appends are expensive on GPU

### 4. Mixed Python/DSL Operations
**Problem**: Batt mixes Python control flow with DSL operations
```python
# Python control
if condition:
    s.append(...)
# DSL operation  
t27 = o_g(I, R7)
# Function calls
t8 = rbind(o_g, R5)
```
**GPU Reality**: Can't mix Python interpreter with GPU kernels

### 5. CPU-to-GPU Transfer Overhead
**Problem**: Every variable would need GPU transfer
- For 1000 operations, potentially 1000 transfers
- Each transfer: ~0.2-0.5ms overhead
- Total overhead: 200-500ms just for transfers
- Current total time: 1461ms (demo parallel)
- **Result**: GPU would be SLOWER

---

## 💡 What CAN Be GPU-Accelerated

### Option 1: Individual Heavy Operations (Current Strategy)
**Target**: Operations that take >5ms
```python
# This one operation could be GPU-accelerated
t27 = o_g(I, R7)  # Takes 10-50ms on complex grids
```
**Pros**:
- ✅ GPU overhead (0.2ms) negligible vs 10-50ms compute
- ✅ Can keep try/except on CPU side
- ✅ Transparent to rest of batt

**Status**: 
- Documented in GPU_O_G_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- Expected 2.3-7.8x speedup for heavy o_g calls
- Hybrid strategy (auto CPU/GPU selection)

### Option 2: Batch Multiple Batt Calls
**Target**: Run multiple independent batt() calls in parallel
```python
# Instead of:
for sample in demos:
    batt(task_id, S, sample['input'], None, log)

# Do:
batch_batt_gpu([sample1, sample2, sample3, sample4, sample5])
```
**Pros**:
- ✅ True parallelism (5 independent calls)
- ✅ GPU batch processing (existing strength)
- ✅ Keep batt structure unchanged

**Status**: 
- **Already achieved** with ThreadPoolExecutor! (Phase 4B)
- 5 demo samples run in parallel on CPU
- Could enhance with GPU for heavy operations

### Option 3: Pre-compile Batt to GPU Kernel (VERY HARD)
**Idea**: Convert entire batt to CUDA kernel
**Challenges**:
- ❌ No try/except in CUDA
- ❌ No dynamic lists
- ❌ No Python functions (rbind, compose, etc.)
- ❌ Would need complete rewrite of DSL in CUDA
- ❌ Huge engineering effort (months)
**Verdict**: NOT FEASIBLE

---

## 📊 Performance Analysis

### Current Performance (Phase 4B)
```
Total time:           5.359s
├─ Demo (5 samples):  1.461s (parallel, CPU)
├─ Test (1 sample):   0.079s  
└─ Other:             3.819s

Single batt() call:   ~0.3s (5 samples / 1.461s ≈ 0.29s)
```

### GPU Option Analysis

#### Option 1: GPU o_g Only
**Expected Impact**:
- o_g makes up ~10-30% of batt execution (varies by task)
- GPU o_g: 2.3-7.8x faster
- Overall improvement: 1.2-1.5x on batt-heavy tasks
- **Total time**: 5.359s → ~4.0s (25% improvement)

#### Option 2: GPU Batch Processing
**Already achieved** via CPU parallelism:
- 5 samples: sequential 1.5s → parallel 1.461s
- Near-optimal (communication overhead minimal)
- GPU wouldn't help (samples already parallel)

#### Option 3: Full GPU Batt
**Estimated**:
- Rewrite effort: 3-6 months
- Transfer overhead: +200-500ms per call
- No try/except: Higher failure rate
- **Result**: Likely SLOWER than current CPU implementation

## ✅ Recommended Approach

### Short Term (Week 4): Hybrid o_g
**Implement**: GPU-accelerated `o_g` with automatic CPU/GPU selection

**Benefits**:
- 1.2-1.5x improvement on o_g-heavy tasks
- Transparent to batt (drop-in replacement)
- Keep try/except safety
- Total time: 5.359s → ~4.0s

**Implementation**:
```python
# In dsl.py or gpu_hybrid.py
def o_g(grid, connectivity):
    # Hybrid approach
    if should_use_gpu(grid, connectivity):
        return gpu_o_g(grid, connectivity)
    else:
        return cpu_o_g(grid, connectivity)
```

**Effort**: 1-2 weeks (see GPU_O_G_IMPLEMENTATION.md)

### Medium Term: Profile More Operations
**Target**: Other heavy operations in batt
- `fgpartition` (partition operations)
- `gravitate` (iterative physics)
- Grid transformations

**Method**:
1. Profile batt execution to find bottlenecks
2. Implement GPU versions of top 3-5 heavy operations
3. Use hybrid strategy for auto-selection

**Expected**: Additional 1.2-1.3x improvement

### Long Term: Consider AOT Compilation
**Idea**: Compile batt to native code (not GPU)
**Tools**: Numba, Cython, mypyc
**Benefits**:
- Keep Python structure
- 2-5x Python speedup
- No GPU needed
- **Total potential**: 5.359s → 1-2s

**Effort**: 2-3 weeks, but high compatibility risk

## 🎯 Specific GPU Modifications (If Pursuing)

### If We Remove Try/Except Blocks

**Challenge**: Batt uses try/except for evolutionary exploration
```python
try:
    t1 = identity(p_g)  # Might fail with wrong types
except:
    t1 = _get_safe_default(identity)  # Safe fallback
```

**GPU Alternative 1: Pre-validation**
```python
# Check types before GPU call
if can_call_identity(p_g):
    t1 = gpu_identity(p_g)
else:
    t1 = _get_safe_default(identity)
```
**Pros**: No exceptions needed
**Cons**: Adds overhead, may miss edge cases

**GPU Alternative 2: Error Flags**
```python
# GPU kernel returns success flag
t1, success = gpu_identity(p_g)
if not success:
    t1 = _get_safe_default(identity)
```
**Pros**: GPU can signal errors
**Cons**: Still need CPU fallback logic

**Verdict**: Try/except removal is POSSIBLE but adds complexity and risk

## 📉 Why Full GPU Batt Is Not Worth It

### 1. Engineering Cost vs Benefit
**Cost**: 3-6 months of development + testing
**Benefit**: Maybe 1.5-2x speedup (optimistic)
**Current**: Already achieved 4.06x with CPU optimizations

### 2. Diminishing Returns
```
Baseline:       21.788s
Current (4.06x): 5.359s  ← 75% reduction already achieved
Theoretical GPU: 2.5-3.5s ← Additional 50% reduction
                         ← But requires 3-6 months work
```

### 3. Maintenance Burden
- GPU code is harder to debug
- Compatibility issues (different GPUs)
- Loss of try/except safety
- More complex testing

### 4. Alternative Approaches Easier
- **Hybrid o_g**: 1-2 weeks for 1.2-1.5x
- **AOT compilation**: 2-3 weeks for 2-5x
- **More CPU optimizations**: Ongoing for gradual improvements

### Long Term Vision
🎯 **Target: 2-3s total time** (10x speedup from baseline)
- Hybrid GPU for heavy operations
- AOT compilation for Python overhead
- Continued algorithmic optimizations

---

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. Sequential Code → Poor GPU Candidate
Batt's sequential dependency chain means no parallelism. GPU would just be a slower single-threaded CPU.

### 2. Python Features → GPU Incompatible
Try/except, dynamic lists, function objects - all require CPU interpreter.

### 3. Transfer Overhead → Killer for Small Ops
0.2ms overhead × 1000 operations = 200ms overhead alone.

### 4. Hybrid > Pure GPU
Automatically select GPU only for operations that benefit (>5ms compute time).

### 5. CPU Optimizations Often Better
We achieved 4.06x with pure CPU optimizations. Sometimes algorithm > hardware.
