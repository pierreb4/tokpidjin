## 📁 Archived Documentation

These files were superseded by newer, more comprehensive documentation:

### Moved to `archive/gpu_docs_superseded/`
- **QUICK_REF.md** - Superseded by GPU_PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
- **SUMMARY.md** - Superseded by GPU_PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
- **GPU_STRATEGY.md** - Superseded by INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md
- **GPU_OPTIMIZATION_APPLIED.md** - Superseded by GPU_OPTIMIZATION_SUCCESS.md

These files contain early analysis about why `rot90` failed (GPU 2x slower) and initial strategy for `fgpartition`. The content is now consolidated in the main documentation.

**Note:** These files are kept for historical reference but should not be used for current development.

## 🎯 Common Use Cases

### "I want to use GPU acceleration in my code"
1. Read **GPU_PROJECT_SUMMARY.md** (5 min)
2. Read **INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md** (10 min)
3. Copy integration pattern from guide
4. Use `auto_select_optimizer()` in your code

### "Which GPU should I choose on Kaggle?"
1. Read **COMPLETE_GPU_COMPARISON.md** (5 min)
2. Summary: Try L4x4 first (35x with 4 GPUs), use T4x2 for reliability (18x with 2 GPUs)
3. All GPUs cost the same - choose based on availability

### "I want to add GPU support for a new DSL function"
1. Read **INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md** - Section "Adding New GPU Functions"
2. Check **GPU_VECTORIZATION_UPDATE.md** for vectorization patterns
3. Follow the template in **gpu_optimizations.py**
4. Test on all GPU types (T4x2, P100, L4x4)

### "I'm getting GPU errors or poor performance"
1. Check **INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md** - "Troubleshooting" section
2. Verify batch size >= 30 grids (optimal: 200)
3. Ensure JIT warmup is included (see **GPU_JIT_WARMUP.md**)
4. Check CPU fallback is working (see **GPU_FALLBACK_FIX.md**)

### "I want to understand how multi-GPU works"
1. Read **MULTI_GPU_SUPPORT.md** (15 min)
