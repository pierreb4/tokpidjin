## 💡 Quick Tips

### Solver GPU Acceleration (New Focus)
- **Target solvers >5ms execution time** - Best GPU candidates
- **Profile before implementing** - Use profile_solvers.py to find bottlenecks
- **Expected 2-6x speedup** - For complex solvers (>15ms even better)
- **Focus on 7% excellent solvers** - 120ms and 58ms execution times found

### Batch Operations (Production Ready)
- **All Kaggle GPUs cost the same** - Choose L4x4 for best performance
- **Batch size 200 is optimal** - For single-GPU operations
- **Multi-GPU auto-enabled** - For batch size >= 120
- **One-line integration** - Use `auto_select_optimizer()`
- **10-35x faster than CPU** - Depending on GPU and batch size
