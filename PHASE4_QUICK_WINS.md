# Phase 4 Quick Wins - Immediate Optimization Opportunities

**Status**: Ready to implement  
**Expected ROI**: 10-30% speedup (2-3x combined with profiling)

---

## The Current Picture

From Phase 2a and Phase 3 data, we know:

```
100-task execution: 24.813s

Confirmed bottlenecks:
1. check_batt function: 5.070s (20%) - already identified
2. solver execution: 1.471s (5.8%)
3. framework overhead: 18.707s (74.2%)
4. validation cache: 18% hit rate (room for improvement)
5. inlining cache: 100% hit rate (opportunity for related caching)
```

---

## Quick Win #1: Validation Cache Expansion

**Current state**: 18% hit rate (480 hits out of 3,200)

**Opportunity**: Expand cache key generation or pre-populate cache

**Problem analysis**:
- 82% of validations are cache misses
- Each miss requires DSL operation execution
- Validation happens for every demo/test sample combination

**Solution options**:

### Option A: Expand cache scope
```python
# Currently: Cache by (solver_id, sample_hash)
# Could: Also cache by pattern matching results
# Time: 1-2 hours
# Expected ROI: 5-10% speedup
```

### Option B: Pre-populate validation cache
```python
# Currently: Build cache during execution
# Could: Pre-load common validation patterns
# Time: 2-3 hours
# Expected ROI: 10-15% speedup
```

### Option C: Reduce validation redundancy
```python
# Currently: Validate for every demo/test sample
# Could: Cache validation results per solver, reuse across samples
# Time: 1-2 hours
# Expected ROI: 15-25% speedup
```

**Recommendation**: Start with Option A (simplest), then expand to C if needed

---

## Quick Win #2: DSL Operation Result Caching

**Current state**: Many DSL operations might be called with same inputs

**Opportunity**: Add memoization to pure DSL operations

**Likely candidates** (based on Phase 2a analysis):
- `objects()` - Already caching diagonals, could cache full results
- `p_g()` - Pattern matching, likely called multiple times
- `fgpartition()` - Partitioning logic, good caching candidate
- `o_g()` - Complex operation, high ROI if cached

**Implementation**:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

# Add to dsl.py
@lru_cache(maxsize=1024)
def objects(g):
    """Cached object detection."""
    # ... existing implementation ...

@lru_cache(maxsize=512)
def p_g(g, pattern):
    """Cached pattern matching."""
    # ... existing implementation ...
```

**Time**: 2-3 hours (need to verify function purity)  
**Expected ROI**: 10-25% speedup (if functions are pure)  
**Risk**: Low (caching is safe for pure functions, fallback to CPU)

---

## Quick Win #3: Batch Validation Processing

**Current state**: Validations happen one at a time

**Opportunity**: Process multiple validations in a batch

**Current code**:
```python
# In run_batt.py check_sample()
for t_n, evo, o_solver_id, okt in sample_o:
    # Validate each output individually
    diff_result = check_diff(okt, t_o)  # One at a time
```

**Optimized code**:
```python
# Process multiple at once if possible
outputs_to_validate = [okt for t_n, evo, o_solver_id, okt in sample_o]
diff_results = batch_check_diff(outputs_to_validate, t_o)
```

**Time**: 2-4 hours  
**Expected ROI**: 5-15% speedup  
**Complexity**: Medium (need to refactor diff checking)

---

## Quick Win #4: Cache Inlining Results

**Current state**: Inlining cache at 100% (perfect)

**Opportunity**: Also cache expanded/inlined solvers to avoid re-expansion

**Current flow**:
1. Generate candidate
2. Inline operations (uses cache)
3. Save inlined solver
4. Next task: repeat steps 1-2

**Optimized flow**:
1. Generate candidate
2. Inline operations (uses cache)
3. **Cache inlined result**
4. Next task: retrieve from cache if possible

**Time**: 1-2 hours  
**Expected ROI**: 3-8% speedup  
**Risk**: Low (just caching, fallback works)

---

## Quick Win #5: Reduce Redundant Scoring

**Current state**: Each demo/test sample scored against all candidates

**Opportunity**: Skip scoring for obviously bad candidates

**Example**:
- If candidate fails on first sample, skip remaining samples
- Early exit on score < threshold

**Current code**:
```python
for sample in all_samples:
    for candidate in candidates:
        check_sample(candidate, sample)  # Always completes
```

**Optimized code**:
```python
for sample in all_samples:
    for candidate in candidates:
        if check_sample(candidate, sample) < threshold:
            break  # Skip remaining samples for this candidate
```

**Time**: 1-2 hours  
**Expected ROI**: 5-10% speedup  
**Risk**: Low (heuristic, can be tuned)

---

## Implementation Order

**Recommended sequence** (by implementation difficulty and ROI):

```
1. Quick Win #4 (Inlining cache) - 1-2h, low risk, 3-8% speedup
   â””â”€ Just cache more aggressively

2. Quick Win #1 (Validation cache) - 1-2h, low risk, 5-10% speedup
   â””â”€ Expand existing cache mechanism

3. Quick Win #5 (Early exit scoring) - 1-2h, low risk, 5-10% speedup
   â””â”€ Heuristic-based optimization

4. Quick Win #2 (DSL operation caching) - 2-3h, medium risk, 10-25% speedup
   â””â”€ Need to verify function purity

5. Quick Win #3 (Batch validation) - 2-4h, medium complexity, 5-15% speedup
   â””â”€ Requires more refactoring
```

**Total time**: 7-15 hours  
**Expected total speedup**: 25-60% framework reduction = 1.8-2.7x overall

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Identify specific files to modify
- [ ] Estimate expected improvement

### During Each Optimization

- [ ] Implement the change
- [ ] Run local test (10-task) to verify correctness

- [ ] If slower: revert or debug
- [ ] If faster: commit with results

### After Each Optimization

- [ ] Record timing in PHASE4_OPTIMIZATIONS.md
- [ ] Update cumulative speedup
- [ ] Note any side effects or issues
- [ ] Decide on next optimization

### Final Validation

- [ ] Run full 100-task test on Kaggle
- [ ] Verify correctness (0 errors, all solvers)
- [ ] Measure final wall-clock time
- [ ] Calculate total Phase 4 speedup
- [ ] Document in PHASE4_RESULTS.md

## Risk Mitigation

**All optimizations reversible**: Each commit can be reverted

**Testing coverage**:
- Local: `python run_batt.py -c 1` (single task)
- Small: `python run_batt.py -c 10` (quick check)
- Full: Kaggle 100-task (final validation)

**Performance regression checks**:
- Track wall-clock time after each optimization
- If any optimization causes slowdown: investigate and revert
- Keep running speedup total visible

---

## Success Metrics

After all optimizations, we should see:

```
Baseline: 24.813s (100 tasks)
Target: 12-14s (2-2.7x speedup)

Intermediate checkpoints:
- After WinS 1-2: ~22.5s (1.1x speedup)
- After Wins 1-3: ~21s (1.2x speedup)
- After Wins 1-4: ~19.5s (1.3x speedup)
- After All Wins: 12-14s (2-2.7x speedup)
```

If we achieve 12-14s, combined with Phase 2a/1b optimizations:
- Total speedup from baseline (42.5s): ~3.5x
- Optimization percentage: -70% âœ…

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Quick Win #4** (Inlining cache expansion) - lowest risk
2. **Implement and measure** - track results
3. **Move to Quick Win #1** (Validation cache) - similar risk level
4. **Profile periodically** - ensure no regressions
5. **Final Kaggle validation** - confirm speedup on production
