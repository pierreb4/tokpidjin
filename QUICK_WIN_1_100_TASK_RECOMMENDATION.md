# 🎯 Next Action: Run 100-Task Benchmark

## Current Status

✅ **Quick Win #1 Implementation**: Complete and validated  
✅ **Unit Tests**: All passing (4/4)  
✅ **5-Task Validation**: 0.95% improvement (expected at small scale)  
✅ **Cache Infrastructure**: Operational and healthy  

## Recommended Action

```bash
bash run_card.sh -c -100
```

## What This Will Tell Us

### If ≥3% Improvement
```
✅ SUCCESS: Quick Win #1 validates at scale
→ Keep cache enabled
→ Proceed to Quick Win #2
→ Expected cumulative: 8-18% speedup
```

### If <3% Improvement
```
⚠️ INVESTIGATE: Cache hit rate lower than expected
→ Analyze: How many duplicate solvers in 100-task run?
→ Options:
  a) Keep and move to higher-impact Quick Wins (#2-5)
  b) Disable and investigate further
  c) Adjust cache strategy
```

## What to Watch For

1. **Wall-clock time**: Expected 23-24s (vs 24.813s baseline)
2. **Cache statistics**: Look for hit rate and time saved
3. **Inlining cache**: Should maintain high hit rate
4. **No regression**: Performance should not decrease

## Success Criteria

| Metric | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Improvement | ≥3% | ⏳ TBD |
| Regression | 0% | ⏳ TBD |
| Cache operational | Yes | ✅ |
| No errors | Yes | ✅ |

## Timeline

- **Now**: Run benchmark
- **While running**: Monitor with `bash follow.sh` (if enabled)
- **After completion**: Review results and statistics
- **Decision**: Continue to Quick Win #2 or investigate

## Fallback Plan (If <3%)

If the 100-task benchmark shows <3% improvement:

1. **Don't panic** - Cache infrastructure is still good, no regression
2. **Analyze**: Review solver body cache statistics
   - How many times did solvers repeat?
   - What was the hit rate?
   - Time saved vs. overhead?
3. **Consider**: 
   - Is solver body caching the right layer to cache?
   - Would caching at a different level help more?
   - Are other Quick Wins higher priority?

## Why This Matters

This one 100-task run will tell us:
- If Quick Win #1 scales as designed
- If our optimization hypothesis is correct
- Whether to keep or pivot the strategy
- Confidence level for Quick Wins #2-5

**This is the validation that determines the Phase 4 trajectory.**
