"""
Phase 3: Update HINT_OVERLAPS in constants.py

Current state: 27 types, includes frozenset-based types
Target state: 15 types, consolidate frozenset to tuple equivalents

Changes:
- Removed: IntegerSet, Indices, IndicesSet, Object, Objects (frozenset variants)
- Kept: Indices, Object, Objects (now tuple-based, redefined in arc_types.py)
- Result: Tuple and FrozenSet both removed from HINT_OVERLAPS (using tuple equivalents)

This analysis shows what needs to be updated.
