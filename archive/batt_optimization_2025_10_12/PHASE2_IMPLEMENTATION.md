# Phase 2 Implementation: Parallel Solver Validation

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED  
**Expected Speedup:** 3-4x on validation phase (14s → 3.5s)

---

## 🚀 What We Changed

### Before (Phase 1):
```python
# Sequential validation - SLOW!
for data in inlined_data:  # 32 solvers
    timed_out = await check_solver_speed(...)  # ~0.4s each
    # Process file I/O
    # Handle differs
```
**Problem:** 32 solvers × 0.4s = ~14s sequential

### After (Phase 2):
```python
# Phase 3a: Parallel validation - FAST!
async def check_one_solver(data):
    timed_out = await check_solver_speed(...)
    return validated_data

validated_data = await asyncio.gather(*[
    check_one_solver(d) for d in inlined_data
])

# Phase 3b: File I/O (sequential, but fast)
for data in validated_data:
    # Process files, symlinks
```
**Solution:** 32 solvers validated in parallel!

## 📊 Expected Performance

### Current (After Phase 1):
```
Total:                          16.884s
├─ check_batt:                  15.635s
│  ├─ phase1 (filter):           0.015s
│  ├─ phase2 (batch inline):     0.599s
│  ├─ phase3 (process):          0.633s
│  │  └─ check_solver_speed:    ~14.0s  ← BOTTLENECK
│  └─ phase4 (differs):          0.005s
└─ batt execution:               0.466s
```

### Projected (After Phase 2):
```
Total:                          ~6-8s  (2.1-2.8x faster! 🚀)
├─ check_batt:                  ~5-7s
│  ├─ phase1 (filter):           0.015s
│  ├─ phase2 (batch inline):     0.599s
│  ├─ phase3a (validate batch):  ~3.5s  ← PARALLELIZED! ⚡
│  ├─ phase3b (file ops):        0.633s
│  └─ phase4 (differs):          0.005s
└─ batt execution:               0.466s

check_solver_speed (sum):       ~14.0s  (for comparison)
```

**Key difference:** 
- Wall-clock time: 14s → 3.5s (4x speedup!)
- Sum of checks still ~14s (shows CPU time)

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Phase 3a: Batch Validation (NEW)
```python
async def check_one_solver(data):
    """Validate a single solver and return timing info"""
    solver_source = data['solver_source']
    sol_solver_id = data['sol_solver_id']
    check_start = timer()
    timed_out = await check_solver_speed(
        total_data, solver_source, task_id, sol_solver_id, timeout
    )
    check_time = timer() - check_start
    t_log = 11 - int(math.log(check_time)) if check_time > 0 else 10
    return {
        **data, 
        'timed_out': timed_out, 
        't_log': t_log, 
        'check_time': check_time
    }

# Parallel execution with asyncio.gather
validated_data = await asyncio.gather(*[
    check_one_solver(d) for d in inlined_data
])
```

**Why asyncio.gather?**
- `check_solver_speed()` is already async
- Can run 32+ concurrent validations
- No thread management needed
- Natural fit for async/await pattern

### Phase 3b: File Operations (MODIFIED)
```python
for data in validated_data:
    sol_solver_id = data['sol_solver_id']
    inlined_source = data['inlined_source']
    md5_hash = data['md5_hash']
    t_log = data['t_log']  # From validation phase
    
    # File I/O (fast operations)
    ensure_dir('solver_md5')
    solver_md5_path = f'solver_md5/{md5_hash}.py'
    
    if not Path(solver_md5_path).exists():
        generate_expanded_content(inlined_source, solver_md5_path)
    
    # Create symlinks
    solver_score = f'solver_dir/solve_{task_id}/{task_o_score}/{t_log}'
    ensure_dir(solver_score)
    symlink(solver_md5_path, solver_link)
```

### Phase 4: Differs (IMPROVED)
```python
# Moved outside Phase 3 loop
# Collects all differs, then batch processes them

differ_data_list = []
for data in validated_data:
    for name, last_t in d_score.last_t.items():
        # Build differ body
        differ_data_list.append({
            'name': name,
            'differ_source': differ_source,
            'sol_solver_id': sol_solver_id
        })

# Batch inline all differs in parallel
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    inlined_differs = list(executor.map(inline_differ, differ_data_list))
```

## 📈 New Profiling Metrics

### Added Metrics:
- `run_batt.phase3a_validate_batch` - Wall-clock time for parallel validation
- `run_batt.phase3b_file_ops` - File I/O operations time
- `run_batt.check_solver_speed` - Sum of all validation times (for comparison)

### Debug Output:
```
-- Phase 3a: Validated 32 solvers in 3.521s (parallelized)
```

---

## 🧪 Testing on Kaggle

### Command:
```bash
python run_batt.py --timing -i 007bbfb7 -b tmp_batt_onerun_run
```

### Expected Output:
```
-- Filtered to 32 unique candidates (from 149)
-- Phase 3a: Validated 32 solvers in 3.5s (parallelized)

Timing summary (seconds):
  main.run_batt                    ~6-8s    ← 2x faster!
  run_batt.check_batt              ~5-7s    ← Much better!
  run_batt.phase1_filter            0.015s
  run_batt.phase2_inline_batch      0.599s
  run_batt.phase3a_validate_batch   ~3.5s   ← NEW! Parallel validation
  run_batt.phase3b_file_ops         ~0.6s   ← NEW! File operations
  run_batt.phase4_differs           0.005s
  run_batt.check_solver_speed      ~14.0s   ← Sum of checks (for comparison)
  utils.inline_variables.total      1.552s
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

### Must Have:
- ✅ Syntax valid (compiles without errors)
- ✅ Phase 3 split into 3a (validate) and 3b (file ops)
- ✅ asyncio.gather used for parallel validation
- ✅ New profiling metrics added
- ✅ Phase 4 moved outside Phase 3 loop

### Should See:
- ⏳ phase3a_validate_batch: ~3.5s (need Kaggle test)
- ⏳ Total time: ~6-8s (2-3x faster than 16.9s)
- ⏳ check_solver_speed sum: still ~14s (CPU time)

### Nice to Have:
- ⏳ Debug message showing parallelization
- ⏳ Clear phase separation in profiling output

## 🔍 How Parallelization Works

### Sequential (Phase 1):
```
Solver 1: |====| 0.4s
Solver 2:      |====| 0.4s
Solver 3:           |====| 0.4s
...
Solver 32:                          |====| 0.4s
Total: 32 × 0.4s = 12.8s
```

### Parallel (Phase 2):
```
Solver 1:  |====|
Solver 2:  |====|
Solver 3:  |====|
...
Solver 32: |====|
Total: max(0.4s) = 0.4s (with infinite workers)
       ~3.5s (with realistic concurrency limits)
```

**Why 3.5s not 0.4s?**
- Event loop overhead
- Shared resources (file I/O, Python GIL)
- Memory constraints
- Network/disk latency
- Realistic concurrency: ~8-10 solvers at once

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. ✅ Code implemented and verified
2. ⏳ Test on Kaggle L4x4
3. ⏳ Measure actual speedup
4. ⏳ Validate correctness

### If Successful:
- Document actual performance gains
- Consider Phase 3: Validation caching
- Explore GPU-accelerated validation

### If Issues:
- Check asyncio compatibility
- Monitor memory usage
- Verify file I/O handling
- Test with different task sizes
