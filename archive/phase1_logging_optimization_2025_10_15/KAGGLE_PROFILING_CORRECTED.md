# Kaggle Profiling Results - Corrected Analysis

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Platform**: Kaggle T4x2 GPU  
**Tasks Profiled**: 100 tasks  
**Batt File**: tmp_batt_onerun_run.py

## Critical Discovery: Profiling Methodology Issue

### The Numbers Don't Add Up ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Wall-clock time**: 110.33 seconds (actual elapsed time)  
**Sum of reported task times**: 1054+ seconds (impossible!)  
**Individual task examples**:
- Task 16: 239.5s
- Task 50: 117.3s  
- Task 56: 101.9s
- Task 79: 180.3s
- Just 4 tasks = 638.9s, but total wall-clock was only 110s!

### Root Cause: cProfile Cumulative Time

**What happened**: cProfile's `total_time` counts **cumulative time including all nested calls**. When function A calls function B:
- A's time includes B's time
- This gets counted multiple times in aggregate
- Result: Sum of times >> actual wall-clock time

**Example**:
```python
def batt():              # cProfile: 10s
    o_g()               # cProfile: 2s
    objects()           # cProfile: 1.5s
    # other work: 6.5s

Total cProfile time: 10 + 2 + 1.5 = 13.5s
Actual wall-clock: 10s
```

### Corrected Understanding

**Actual execution**:
- **Wall-clock time**: 110.33 seconds for 100 tasks
- **Average per task**: 1.1 seconds (not 10.5s!)
- **This matches local testing**: ~1.4s/task

**What cProfile actually measures**:
- Time spent **within each function**
- Includes time in **nested calls**
- Not suitable for aggregating across function calls
- Good for identifying **individual hot functions**

## Corrected Analysis

### Real Performance Numbers

**100 tasks in 110 seconds**:
- Average: 1.1s per task
- This is actually **GOOD** - close to local performance!
- GPU overhead is minimal (1.1s vs 1.4s local)

### DSL Function Analysis (Corrected Interpretation)

Looking at **function call counts and patterns**, not cumulative time:

| Function | Calls | Avg per Call | Interpretation |
|----------|-------|--------------|----------------|
| connect | 319,351 | 0.0039ms | Many small calls - CPU overhead |
| dneighbors | 261,268 | 0.0026ms | Many small calls - CPU overhead |
| o_g | 3,400 | 0.0196ms | **34 per task** - reasonable |
| objects | 3,400 | 0.2880ms | **34 per task** - slow! |
| objects_t | 600 | 0.4525ms | 6 per task - very slow! |

### Key Insights

**1. High-frequency, low-cost functions**:
- `connect`: 3,193 calls/task √ó 0.0039ms = 12.5ms/task
- `dneighbors`: 2,612 calls/task √ó 0.0026ms = 6.8ms/task
- Combined: 19.3ms/task = **1.8% of 1.1s**

**2. Medium-frequency, high-cost functions**:
- `objects`: 34 calls/task √ó 0.288ms = 9.8ms/task = **0.9% of 1.1s**
- `o_g`: 34 calls/task √ó 0.020ms = 0.7ms/task = **0.06% of 1.1s**
- `objects_t`: 6 calls/task √ó 0.453ms = 2.7ms/task = **0.25% of 1.1s**

**3. Unknown overhead**: 1100ms - 32.8ms DSL = **1067ms/task (97%) unaccounted**

## What's Really Happening?

The profiler **only captures time spent in Python DSL functions**. It's **missing**:

1. **Batt framework overhead** (~1067ms/task):
   - batch_process_samples_gpu() logic
   - Candidate generation and filtering
   - GPU batch processing coordination
   - Memory management

2. **GPU operations** (not in Python DSL):
   - GPU kernel execution time
   - CPU‚ÜîGPU transfers
   - GPU memory operations

3. **Python interpreter overhead**:
   - Function calls
   - Exception handling (try/except in every line)
   - Type checking

## Revised Strategy

### Current State
- **Actual execution**: 1.1s/task (110s for 100 tasks)
- **DSL functions**: ~33ms/task (3% of time)
- **Unknown overhead**: ~1067ms/task (97% of time)

### At 400 Tasks Scale
- **Current**: 440 seconds (7.3 minutes)
- **Not bad!** Much better than feared 4216s

### Optimization Opportunities

**Priority 1: Profile the Unknown 97%** ‚è∞
- Use `line_profiler` on batt() execution
- Measure batch_process_samples_gpu() time
- Identify actual bottlenecks

**Priority 2: GPU DSL Operations** (If Worth It)
- `objects`: 0.288ms/call ‚Üí GPU could be 0.05-0.1ms
- Savings: ~7ms/task = 2.8s at 400 tasks
- ROI: **Low** (0.6% improvement)

**Priority 3: Framework Optimization** (If Needed)
- Depends on line_profiler results
- Optimize the 97% unknown time

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Acknowledge profiling methodology issue
2. üîÑ Use line_profiler for wall-clock timing
3. ‚è≥ Profile actual batt() execution flow
4. ‚è≥ Measure GPU batch operation overhead
5. ‚è≥ Identify real bottlenecks (the 97%)
6. ‚è≥ Optimize based on actual data

## Conclusion

**Previous analysis was WRONG** - based on cumulative cProfile times that don't reflect reality.

**Actual performance is GOOD** - 1.1s/task = 440s for 400 tasks.

**Real question**: What's taking the other 97% of time (1067ms/task)?

**Can't optimize without knowing what's slow!**

---

**Status**: Need better profiling tool (line_profiler) to see actual bottlenecks  
**Action**: Profile batt() execution with line_profiler to measure wall-clock time per line  
**Expected**: Will reveal where the 1067ms/task is actually spent
