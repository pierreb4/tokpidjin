# DSL Profiling - Session Summary

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Session Goal**: Profile DSL operations to identify GPU acceleration targets  
**Status**: ✅ Profiling tools ready for Kaggle deployment

## What We Accomplished

### 1. ✅ Understood the Real Bottleneck
- **Code generation**: 4s at 400 tasks (9% of time) - NOT the bottleneck
- **Solver execution**: 38.5s at 400 tasks (91% of time) - THE real bottleneck
- **Target**: GPU-accelerate DSL operations within solvers, not batch grid processing

### 2. ✅ Created Profiling Tools

**profile_batt_dsl.py** (229 lines)
- Single-task DSL function profiler
- Shows per-function call counts, times, percentages
- Provides GPU priority recommendations (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Works with any generated batt file

**profile_batt_batch.py** (274 lines)
- Multi-task aggregate profiler
- Processes 20-400 tasks, aggregates statistics
- Identifies consistent bottlenecks across tasks
- Calculates expected GPU speedup impact
- Saves results to JSON for analysis

### 3. ✅ Documented Profiling Workflow

**PROFILING_README.md** (comprehensive guide)
- Why local profiling doesn't work (threading/no GPU)
- How to profile on Kaggle (step-by-step)
- Expected results based on GPU_SOLVER_STRATEGY.md
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Implementation priorities

**Updated .github/copilot-instructions.md**
- Added profiling workflow section
- Clarified local vs Kaggle development cycle
- Documented "Profile on Kaggle, not locally" rule

### 4. ✅ Committed and Pushed to Repo

**Commit**: `a059473d`
- All profiling tools
- Documentation updates
- Ready for Kaggle deployment

## Key Insights

### Why Local Profiling Failed
```
Local laptop issues:
- Threading/multiprocessing in run_batt.py obscures DSL function times
- No GPU to test actual GPU code paths  
- Different execution model than production

Result: 28.5s total execution, but "No significant DSL calls detected"
```

### Why Kaggle Profiling Will Work
```
Kaggle advantages:
- Real GPU environment (T4x2, P100, L4x4)
- Production batt functions with real solvers
- Accurate timing without threading interference
- Can test GPU code paths immediately

Expected result: o_g/objects 15-30%, clear bottlenecks identified
```

## Expected Results from Kaggle

Based on GPU_SOLVER_STRATEGY.md and PIPELINE_SCALE_ANALYSIS.md:

### Production Scale Context
- **Competition resources**: 8 hours of L4x4 GPU time (Kaggle ARC competition)
- **Production target**: 400-1000 tasks, ~3,000-7,500 samples
- **Current solver baseline**: 5.3ms/sample → 15.9-39.7s at scale
- **Philosophy**: With 8hr compute budget, all GPU optimizations are worthwhile

### Scale Impact
At 32 tasks (current testing):
- Solver time: 0.7s (optimization ROI: Low)
- GPU speedup saves: 0.6-0.7s

At 400 tasks (production):
- Solver time: 15.9s (optimization ROI: HIGH)
- GPU speedup saves: 14.5-15.5s (97% faster)

**Key insight**: GPU optimization becomes essential at production scale!

### HIGH PRIORITY (>10% execution time)
- **o_g** / **objects**: 15-30% of execution time
  - Expected GPU speedup: 3-6x
  - Impact: Major speedup on complex solvers
  - At 400 tasks: 9.9-13.2s saved

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (5-10% execution time)
- **fgpartition** / **partition**: 5-15% of execution time
- **gravitate**: 3-10% of execution time
  - Expected GPU speedup: 2-4x each
  - Impact: Complementary to o_g acceleration

### LOW PRIORITY (1-5% execution time)
- Various other DSL operations
- Implement after HIGH/MEDIUM complete

### Overall Impact Projection
```
Current (400 tasks): 42.5s total (4s code gen + 38.5s solver)

After GPU DSL (2-6x on solver):
  - Code gen: 4s (unchanged)
  - Solver: 6-19s (2-6x faster)
  - Total: 10-23s

After Batch Operations (10-35x on batched ops):
  - Even better performance
  - Solver: 0.45-1.6s (10-35x faster)
  - Total: 4.5-5.6s

Combined (both optimizations):
  - Code gen: 4s
  - Solver: 0.3-0.5s (30-50x faster)
  - Total: 4.3-4.5s vs 42.5s baseline
  - Overall speedup: 9-10x faster!

Scale insight: At 32 tasks (0.7s solver), GPU saves 0.6s
             At 400 tasks (15.9s solver), GPU saves 15.5s
             ROI increases 25x with scale!
```

## Next Steps (Kaggle Workflow)

### Step 1: Deploy to Kaggle ⏳
```python
# Upload these files:
- profile_batt_dsl.py
- profile_batt_batch.py  
- tmp_batt_onerun_run.py (or other generated batt)

# Enable GPU: Settings → Accelerator → GPU T4 x2
```

### Step 2: Run Profiler ⏳
```bash
# In Kaggle notebook:
!python profile_batt_batch.py -f tmp_batt_onerun_run -n 100 -o results.json

# Download results.json
# Analyze HIGH/MEDIUM priority functions
```

### Step 3: Implement GPU Operations ⏳
```python
# For top bottleneck (likely o_g):
1. Check if gpu_o_g exists in dsl.py
2. Implement hybrid approach:
   - Arrays/tuples on GPU for computation
   - Convert to frozenset at function boundaries
3. Add CPU fallback for small inputs
4. Test on Kaggle with GPU enabled
5. Measure actual vs expected speedup
```

### Step 4: Iterate ⏳
```python
# Re-run profiler with GPU ops enabled
# Implement #2 and #3 bottlenecks
# Target: 2-4x overall solver speedup
# Final: 38.5s → 10-15s for 400 tasks
```
