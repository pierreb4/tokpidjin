# Kaggle Profiling Results - Analysis

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Hardware**: Kaggle T4x2 (2 GPUs)  
**Tasks Profiled**: 100  
**Status**: ⚠️ Results need interpretation

## Raw Results

### Execution Times
- **Total execution**: 1054 seconds (17.5 minutes)
- **Average per task**: 10.5 seconds
- **Expected per task**: 1.4 seconds (from local testing)
- **Overhead factor**: 7.5x slower than expected

### Top DSL Functions (by absolute time)

| Function | Total Time | Calls | Per-Call | % of Total | Expected % |
|----------|-----------|-------|----------|------------|------------|
| connect | 16.9s | 319,351 | 0.053ms | 1.6% | ~5-10% |
| dneighbors | 13.6s | 261,268 | 0.052ms | 1.3% | ~3-5% |
| **o_g** | **13.2s** | **3,400** | **3.88ms** | **1.3%** | **15-30%** |
| **objects** | **12.9s** | **3,400** | **3.79ms** | **1.2%** | **15-30%** |
| objects_t | 4.4s | 600 | 7.4ms | 0.4% | ~5-10% |
| mapply | 1.6s | 3,400 | 0.48ms | 0.2% | ~1-3% |
| neighbors | 1.3s | 8,376 | 0.15ms | 0.1% | ~1-2% |

## Critical Issue: Profiling Overhead

### The Problem

**Expected behavior**:
- DSL functions should be 50-80% of execution time
- o_g/objects should dominate (15-30% each)

**Actual behavior**:
- DSL functions are only 6.4% of execution time (67.8s / 1054s)
- o_g/objects are only 1.3% each
- **Where is the other 93.6% going?**

### Likely Causes

1. **GPU initialization overhead** (MultiGPUOptimizer)
   - First task: 2.0 seconds
   - Includes CuPy setup, GPU detection, memory allocation
   - Should be one-time, but profiler counts it

2. **Batt framework overhead**
   - `batt_gpu.py` batch processing
   - GPU memory transfers
   - Candidate generation and validation

3. **Python profiling overhead**
   - cProfile adds significant overhead (~20-30%)
   - May be amplified with GPU operations

4. **Import and module loading**
   - Each task imports batt module
   - GPU environment setup
   - Safe DSL wrappers

## Adjusted Analysis

### What We Actually Learned

Even with profiling overhead, we can extract useful insights:

**Absolute DSL Function Times (what matters for optimization):**
- **o_g + objects: 26.1 seconds total**
  - That's **132ms per task average**
  - At 400 tasks: **52.8 seconds**
  - GPU 3-6x speedup: **Saves 35-44 seconds** ✅

- **connect + dneighbors: 30.5 seconds total**
  - That's **305ms per task average**
  - At 400 tasks: **122 seconds**
  - But these are simple operations (0.05ms per call)
  - GPU overhead would make them slower ❌

### Real Bottleneck

The **93.6% unaccounted time** includes:
- Batt execution framework
- GPU batch processing overhead
- Memory transfers
- Candidate generation logic
- Python interpreter overhead

**This is where our batch operations optimization should focus!**

## Revised Strategy

### Phase 1: Profile Batt Execution (Not DSL)

We need to profile **what batt() itself is doing**, not just DSL calls:

```python
# Instead of profiling DSL functions
# Profile the batt execution flow:
1. Candidate generation loop
2. GPU batch processing
3. Memory transfers
4. Validation logic
```

### Phase 2: GPU DSL Operations (Still Valid)

Even though o_g/objects show as 1.3%, their **absolute time is significant**:
- **26.1s over 100 tasks**
- **52.8s projected for 400 tasks**
- **35-44s savings with 3-6x GPU speedup**

This **IS worth optimizing**!

### Phase 3: Batch Operations Integration

The 93.6% overhead suggests opportunity for:
- Better GPU batch processing
- Reduced memory transfers
- Optimized candidate generation
- Parallel sample processing

## Corrected ROI Calculation

### Current Understanding

**At 100 tasks (measured):**
- Total time: 1054s
- DSL time: 67.8s (6.4%)
- Framework time: 986.2s (93.6%)

**Projected 400 tasks:**
- Total time: 4216s (70 minutes)
- DSL time: 271s (6.4%)
- Framework time: 3945s (93.6%)

### With GPU DSL Acceleration

**o_g/objects GPU-accelerated (3-6x):**
- Current: 52.8s
- After GPU: 8.8-17.6s
- **Savings: 35-44s**
- **Overall speedup: 4216s → 4172-4181s (1-1.5% faster)**

### With Batch Operations Optimization

**If we optimize the 93.6% overhead:**
- Target 2-5x speedup on framework
- Savings: 1972-3156s
- **Overall speedup: 4216s → 1060-2244s (47-75% faster)**

**This is the real opportunity!**

## Recommendations

### ✅ DO: Optimize Batch Processing

1. **Profile batt() execution flow**
   - Use line_profiler instead of cProfile
   - Focus on batt_gpu.py batch processing
   - Identify GPU memory transfer overhead

2. **Optimize GPU batch operations**
   - Reduce CPU↔GPU transfers
   - Better batch sizing
   - Parallel candidate processing

3. **GPU-resident optimization**
   - Keep data on GPU between operations
   - Chain operations without CPU transfer
   - Use GPU for validation logic

### ✅ DO: GPU-Accelerate DSL (Secondary)

Even with low percentage, absolute time matters:
- o_g/objects: 52.8s at 400 tasks
- GPU speedup: Saves 35-44s
- Worth implementing after batch ops

### ❌ DON'T: GPU-Accelerate Simple Ops

- connect, dneighbors: <0.1ms per call
- GPU overhead > speedup
- Keep on CPU

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)

1. **Profile batt() execution with line_profiler**
   ```bash
   kernprof -l -v tmp_batt_onerun_run.py
   ```

2. **Measure GPU batch processing overhead**
   - Time batch_process_samples_gpu()
   - Count CPU↔GPU transfers
   - Identify memory bottlenecks

3. **Analyze framework overhead**
   - Where is 93.6% going?
   - Can we reduce it?
   - Parallel opportunities?

### This Week

1. **Optimize batch processing** (highest impact)
2. **Implement GPU o_g/objects** (secondary)
3. **Measure combined effect**

### Expected Results

**With batch optimization:**
- 4216s → 1000-2000s (50-75% faster)

**With GPU DSL added:**
- 1000-2000s → 950-1950s (additional 2-5% faster)

**Combined:**
- **4216s → 950-1950s (55-77% faster overall)**

## Conclusion

The profiling revealed something more important than expected:
- ❌ DSL functions are not the bottleneck (only 6.4%)
- ✅ **Batt execution framework is the bottleneck (93.6%)**
- ✅ GPU batch processing needs optimization
- ✅ DSL GPU acceleration is still worth it (35-44s savings)

**Revised priority:**
1. **HIGHEST**: Optimize batt() batch processing (framework)
2. **HIGH**: GPU-accelerate o_g/objects (DSL)
3. **LOW**: Other optimizations

**Philosophy update**: With 8hr compute budget, optimize BOTH!

---

**Status**: Profiling revealed unexpected bottleneck - framework overhead!  
**Next**: Profile batt() execution flow with line_profiler  
**Expected**: 55-77% overall speedup combining both optimizations
