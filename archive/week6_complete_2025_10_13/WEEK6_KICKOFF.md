# Week 6 Kickoff: Smart Optimization for All Environments

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Status**: Ready to Start! 🚀

## The Critical Realization

### What We Almost Did Wrong ❌
```
"GPU is 10x slower! Disable it!"
"Laptop is fast, optimize for that!"
"Use 8+ workers for maximum parallelism!"
```

### What We're Actually Doing ✅
```
"Laptop is 10x faster than Kaggle CPU - not representative!"
"Kaggle's containerized CPU is the real bottleneck"
"Server will run 8 concurrent instances - be conservative"
"Cache everything - helps all environments"
```

## The Three Environments

### 1. Laptop (Development) 🖥️
- **Fast CPU**: ~10x faster single-core than Kaggle
- **Use Case**: Quick testing, not production
- **Performance**: ~1s per task (misleading!)
- **Strategy**: Test correctness, don't optimize for this

### 2. Kaggle (Competition) 🏆
- **Slow CPU**: Containerized, 5-10x slower than laptop
- **Use Case**: Competition submission, 400 tasks in <9 hours
- **Performance**: ~6.9s per task (actual bottleneck!)
- **Strategy**: Cache + parallel processing for slow CPU

### 3. Server (Production) 🔧
- **Moderate CPU**: Multiple concurrent instances
- **Use Case**: 8× run_card.sh running simultaneously
- **Performance**: Unknown, but must share resources
- **Strategy**: Conservative workers (4), shared cache

## Week 6 Strategy: Cache First, Parallelize Second

### Week 6A: Implement Caching (Days 1-2) - LOW RISK, HIGH IMPACT
**Priority**: Cache EVERYTHING

1. **Validation Cache** (Task 1)
   - Cache solver validation results
   - Impact: 2.770s → 0.5s on repeat runs (5.5x!)
   - Works: All environments, especially multi-instance server

2. **Inlining Cache** (Task 2)
   - Cache inline_variables results
   - Impact: 2.989s → 1.5s on cache hits (2x)
   - Works: All environments, critical for server

**Expected Results After Week 6A**:
```
Kaggle (first run):     6.9s → 6.9s (no change, cold cache)
Kaggle (second run):    6.9s → 3.0s (2.3x faster, warm cache)
Server (8 instances):   First instance slow, rest fast!
```

### Week 6B: Parallel Processing (Days 3-4) - MEDIUM RISK, HIGH IMPACT
**Priority**: Use slow CPU cores in parallel

3. **Parallel Validation** (Task 3)
   - 4 workers (conservative for server)
   - Impact: 2.770s → 0.7-1.0s (3-4x)
   - Why 4?: Server will run 8 instances (32 cores / 8 = 4 per instance)

4. **Parallel Inlining** (Task 4)
   - 4 workers (watch memory!)
   - Impact: 2.989s → 1.0-1.5s (2-3x)
   - Risk: Memory usage, process startup overhead

**Expected Results After Week 6B**:
```
Kaggle (first run):     6.9s → 2.5-3.5s (2-3x faster)
Kaggle (cached run):    3.0s → 1.5-2.0s (3-4x faster)
Server (8 instances):   All complete efficiently, no starvation
```

### Week 6C: Algorithm Optimization (Day 5) - MEDIUM RISK, MEDIUM IMPACT
**Priority**: Profile and optimize hot paths

5. **Profile on Kaggle** (Task 5)
   - Skip inlining for simple cases
   - Optimize AST operations
   - Reduce redundant checks
   - Impact: Additional 20-30% improvement

**Expected Results After Week 6C**:
```
Kaggle (first run):     2.5-3.5s → 2.0-3.0s
Kaggle (cached run):    1.5-2.0s → 1.2-1.6s
```

### Week 6D: Multi-Instance Testing (Days 6-7) - VALIDATION
**Priority**: Ensure server deployment works

6. **Simulate Server Load** (Task 6)
   - Run 8 concurrent instances
   - Test shared cache (Redis or filesystem)
   - Monitor for resource starvation
   - Tune worker counts if needed

**Expected Results After Week 6D**:
```
Server (8 instances × 400 tasks = 3200 total):
  - Per instance: 2-3 hours
  - All instances: 2-3 hours (parallel)
  - Cache hit rate: 90%+
  - No starvation: All complete within 2x of best
```

## Performance Targets

### Kaggle Competition
```
Component           Current    Target     Speedup
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Variable Inlining   2.989s     1.0-1.5s   2-3x
Solver Validation   2.770s     0.5-1.0s   3-5x
Inline Batch        0.976s     0.5-0.7s   1.5-2x
Batt (keep GPU!)    0.379s     0.379s     1x
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total (first run)   6.9s       2.5-3.5s   2-3x
Total (cached run)  6.9s       1.5-2.0s   3-5x
```

### Server Deployment
```
Metric                  Target
────────────────────────────────────
Per-task time           3-5s
Per instance (400)      2-3 hours
All instances (8×)      2-3 hours
Cache hit rate          90%+
No starvation           ✓
```

## Key Design Decisions

### ✅ DO
1. **Cache aggressively** - Validation results, inlining results
2. **Use 4 workers** - Conservative for multi-instance server
3. **Shared cache** - Redis or filesystem for server instances
4. **Keep GPU code** - Correct threshold, need for future mega-batches
5. **Profile on Kaggle** - Laptop performance misleading
6. **Test multi-instance** - Critical for server deployment

### ❌ DON'T
1. **Disable GPU** - We need it, threshold is correct
2. **Optimize for laptop** - Not representative of production
3. **Use 8+ workers** - Will starve other server instances
4. **Ignore memory** - Server constraint with multiple instances
5. **Skip caching** - Highest ROI optimization
6. **Make assumptions** - Profile on actual Kaggle environment

- Maintainable: Clear code, good documentation
- Flexible: Easy to adjust for different deployments

## What Changed from Original Plan?

### Original Plan (Wrong)
```
"GPU is 10x slower, disable it!"
→ Would have broken future mega-batch capability

"Optimize for laptop performance!"
→ Would have been useless for Kaggle/server

"Use 8+ workers for maximum speed!"
→ Would have starved other server instances
```

### Revised Plan (Right)
```
"Laptop is 10x faster - not representative!"
→ Profile and optimize for Kaggle's slow CPU

"Cache everything first!"
→ Helps all environments, especially server

"Use 4 workers (conservative)"
→ Server-friendly, no resource starvation
```

## Key Insight

**Week 5**: GPU works great for large batches (100+ samples)  
**Week 6**: Kaggle CPU is the bottleneck, not GPU  
**Week 7+**: Mega-batch architecture to unlock true GPU potential

The real win is understanding the deployment environments and optimizing for actual constraints, not misleading laptop benchmarks!

## Let's Go! 🚀

**First Task**: Implement validation cache (Task 1)
- Start file: `run_batt.py` or new `batt_cache.py`
- Expected time: 2-3 hours
- Expected impact: 5.5x on cached runs
- Risk: LOW (pure optimization, easy rollback)

Ready to start Week 6 optimization! 💪
