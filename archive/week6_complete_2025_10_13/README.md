## Current Active Documentation (Root Directory)

### Week 6 Complete
- **WEEK6_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md** - Comprehensive Week 6A & 6B summary (START HERE)
- **WEEK6A_COMPLETE_ANALYSIS.md** - Detailed Week 6A cache analysis
- **WEEK6B_LOKY_INSTALL.md** - Installation guide for loky (required for Week 6B)

### Implementation Files
- **batt_cache.py** - Cache implementation (~350 lines)
- **run_batt.py** - Main execution with parallel processing

## Status

- âœ… Week 6A COMPLETE - Cache integration (2.8x speedup)
- âœ… Week 6B COMPLETE - Parallel sample processing (1.25x additional speedup)
- ðŸŽ¯ Total Achievement: 3.6x speedup from baseline (~8s â†’ ~2.2s per task)

## What Changed

### Week 6A: Smart Caching
- Validation cache: 14x speedup
- Inlining cache: 7.3x speedup (78-80% hit rate)
- Discovery: Validation already 18x parallelized (no further optimization needed)

### Week 6B: Unified Sample Processing
- Combined demo + test samples in single parallel batch
- ProcessPoolExecutor (4 workers) for CPU mode
- Loky integration for DSL closure serialization
- Result: 20-30% speedup on multi-sample tasks

## Key Learnings

1. **Cache expensive operations** - AST transformations perfect candidate
2. **Profiler can mislead** - CPU time sum â‰  wall-clock time
3. **Unified batching wins** - Better worker utilization
4. **Pickle limitations real** - Use loky for closures
5. **Measure before optimizing** - Found validation already optimal

## Next Steps

**Week 6C**: Algorithm optimizations
- Target: batt.demo.parallel (2.3s, 75% of execution)
- Expected: 15-20% additional improvement
- Techniques: Early termination, smart ordering, reduce redundant work
