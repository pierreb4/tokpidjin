   - Validation
   - I/O overhead
3. Calculate solver % of total time
4. Identify bottlenecks
5. Confirm optimization priorities

# On Kaggle with L4x4
python profile_pipeline.py --tasks 32
```

**Success Metrics:**

2. Route sample processing through batch operations
3. Test on 32 tasks (validate speedup)
4. Scale to 100+ tasks (confirm scaling)
5. Optimize batch size for L4x4

**Implementation Plan:**

   - Remove initialization of unused `gpu_optimizer` (line 87)
   - Instantiate `GPUBatchProcessor` in `check_batt()`
   - Route samples through `process_batch()`
   - Maintain CPU fallback
2. Test locally (CPU fallback)
3. Test on Kaggle (GPU acceleration)

**Day 2 - Testing & Optimization (6-8 hours):**
1. Validate correctness (all solvers pass)
2. Measure speedup (expect 10-35x)
3. Tune batch size for L4x4 (test 100, 200, 400)
4. Profile memory usage
5. Document results

**Success Metrics:**
- ✅ 10-35x speedup achieved on 32 tasks

## Philosophy

### Old Mindset
❌ "Is this optimization worth the effort?"
❌ "That's only a 5% improvement"
❌ "Good enough is good enough"

### New Mindset
✅ **"We have 8 hours of L4x4 - optimize everything!"**
✅ **"Every second saved enables more experimentation"**
✅ **"Multi-week efforts justified for small gains"**
✅ **"Big wins first, but don't stop there"**

### Guiding Principles
1. **Data-driven**: Profile, measure, validate
2. **Big wins first**: Prioritize by ROI
3. **No stopping**: Continue after "good enough"
4. **Risk-aware**: CPU fallbacks, extensive testing
5. **Think long-term**: Multi-week efforts OK
6. **Resource-aware**: 8 hours = optimize aggressively
