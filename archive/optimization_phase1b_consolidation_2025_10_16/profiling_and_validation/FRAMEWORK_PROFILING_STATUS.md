# Framework Profiling Status

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Kaggle deployment  
**Priority**: 🔴 HIGH (saves 812-1299s at 400 tasks)

## Summary

Created detailed framework profiling tool to identify specific bottlenecks within the 92.4% framework overhead.

## Background

### Previous Profiling Results
- **Framework overhead**: 92.4% of execution time (1624s at 400 tasks)
- **DSL operations**: 7.6% of execution time (133s at 400 tasks)
- **Validation**: Confirmed after removing 4 outlier tasks with infinite loops
- **Conclusion**: Framework is THE bottleneck, must profile in detail

### Why Detailed Profiling?

Previous cProfile showed high-level categories:
- **Framework**: 92.4% ← Need to break this down!
- **DSL**: 7.6%

We need to know:
1. Which framework functions are slow?
2. How much time does each consume?
3. Which are worth optimizing?

### Line Profiler Attempt - FAILED

- Created `tmp_batt_onerun_run.py` with `@profile` decorator
- Ran line_profiler on Kaggle
- **Result**: No timing data collected (Total time: 0s)
- **Cause**: Function didn't execute properly or profiler not activated

### New Approach - cProfile with Categorization ✅

Use cProfile (which works) with automatic function categorization to identify bottlenecks.

## Created Tools

### profile_batt_framework.py

**Purpose**: Identify specific framework bottlenecks using cProfile

**Features**:
1. **Automatic categorization** - Groups functions into categories:
   - GPU Batch Processing
   - Dedupe Operations
   - Tuple Operations
   - Frozenset Operations
   - Candidate Management
   - Result Collection
   - Error Handling
   - DSL Operations
   - Other Framework

2. **Detailed analysis**:
   - Category totals with percentages
   - Top 5 functions per category
   - Per-call timing data
   - Full profiling stats

3. **Configurable**:
   - `--tasks N` to control profiling scope
   - Works on any batt() generated solver

**Usage**:
```bash
# Quick test (5-10 tasks)
python profile_batt_framework.py --tasks 5

# Standard profiling (100 tasks, matches previous)
python profile_batt_framework.py --tasks 100

# Full profiling (400 tasks, production scale)
python profile_batt_framework.py --tasks 400
```

**Output**:
- Console: Category summary + top functions
- File: `profile_batt_framework_TIMESTAMP.txt` (detailed report)

### FRAMEWORK_PROFILING_GUIDE.md

**Purpose**: Complete guide for framework profiling workflow

**Contents**:
1. Background and context
2. Profiling script usage
3. Expected bottlenecks (based on code analysis)
4. Analysis workflow
5. Optimization strategies
6. Success criteria

## Expected Bottlenecks

Based on code analysis (found 7 GPU batch patterns):

### Primary Suspects (likely >20% each):

1. **`batch_process_samples_gpu`** - GPU memory transfers
   - 7 calls per execution
   - Each call processes all training samples
   - CPU ↔ GPU data transfer overhead

2. **`dedupe`** - Set deduplication
   - 14 calls per execution (2× per batch)
   - Removes duplicate grids from results
   - Set comparison operations

### Secondary Suspects (likely 5-15% each):

3. **`difference_tuple`** - Tuple difference operations
   - Called after each dedupe pair
   - Compares two tuples element-wise

4. **`get_nth_t`** - Tuple element extraction
   - Extracts elements from tuples
   - Simple but called frequently

5. **Candidate management** - `_get_safe_default`, `append`
   - Error handling fallbacks
   - List append operations

### Optimization Strategy by Bottleneck

**If `batch_process_samples_gpu` is bottleneck**:
- Reduce GPU memory transfers
- Optimize batch size
- Pipeline GPU operations (keep data on GPU)
- → Expected 2-3x speedup

**If `dedupe` is bottleneck**:
- Cache dedupe results
- Use faster data structures (dict vs set)
- Batch dedupe operations
- → Expected 2-4x speedup

**If tuple operations are bottleneck**:
- Use arrays instead of tuples internally
- Cache frequently accessed elements
- Batch tuple operations
- → Expected 1.5-2x speedup

**Combined optimizations**:
- **Conservative**: 2x framework speedup (saves 812s)
- **Aggressive**: 5x framework speedup (saves 1299s)
- **With DSL**: 1.9-4.3x overall speedup

## Next Steps

### Step 1: Deploy to Kaggle ⏳

```bash
# Upload profile_batt_framework.py to Kaggle
# Make sure tmp_batt_onerun_run.py exists (generated solver)
# Enable GPU (T4x2 or L4x4)
# Run profiling:
python profile_batt_framework.py --tasks 100
```

### Step 2: Analyze Results 📊

1. Download `profile_batt_framework_TIMESTAMP.txt`
2. Review category breakdown:
   - Which categories >10% of time?
   - Which functions have high per-call time?
   - Which functions called most frequently?

3. Identify top 3-5 bottlenecks

### Step 3: Create Optimization Plan 📝

Based on profiling data:
1. Rank bottlenecks by impact (% of total time)
2. Estimate optimization difficulty (low/medium/high)
3. Calculate expected speedup per optimization
4. Prioritize by ROI (impact / difficulty)

### Step 4: Implement Optimizations 🔧

Start with highest-impact optimizations:
1. Implement optimization
2. Add tests for correctness
3. Profile to measure speedup
4. Iterate until 2-5x framework speedup achieved

### Step 5: Validate & Document 📄

1. Re-run full profiling (100-400 tasks)
2. Verify speedup matches expectation
3. Validate correctness across all tasks
4. Update documentation with results
5. Update todo list and copilot instructions

## Success Metrics

### Profiling Success ✅
- Clear bottleneck identification (functions >10% of time)
- Category breakdown with percentages
- Per-call timing data for optimization planning

### Optimization Success 🎯
- **Minimum**: 2x framework speedup (saves 812s at 400 tasks)
- **Target**: 3-4x framework speedup (saves 1083-1299s)
- **Stretch**: 5x framework speedup (saves 1299s)

### Combined Success 🏆
- Framework optimization: 2-5x
- DSL optimization: 3-6x on 7.6%
- **Overall**: 1.9-4.3x total speedup
- **Result**: 1757s → 413-909s (7-15 min vs 29 min)

## Budget Context

With **8 hours of L4x4 GPU time** (28,800 seconds):
- Baseline pipeline: 1757s per run → 16 runs in budget
- Optimized pipeline: 413-909s per run → 32-70 runs in budget
- **Result**: 2-4× more experiments possible!

All optimizations are worthwhile with this budget! 🎉
