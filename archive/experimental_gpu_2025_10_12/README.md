## üîÑ Why Archived

### 1. Superseded by Better Code
Early prototypes were replaced with more robust, tested implementations:
- **gpu_optimizations.py** - Production-ready GPU code (530 lines, validated)
- **gpu_hybrid.py** - Hybrid CPU/GPU strategy (auto-selection)
- **gpu_dsl.py** - GPU-accelerated DSL operations

### 2. Architectural Changes
Initial approaches were modified based on findings:
- Individual operation GPU acceleration ‚Üí Batch processing
- Manual device selection ‚Üí Automatic detection
- Separate GPU DSL ‚Üí Integrated hybrid approach

### 3. Better Documentation
Example files replaced by:
- **QUICK_START.md** - Comprehensive onboarding
- **GPU_README.md** - Quick start with examples
- **test_kaggle_gpu_optimized.py** - Production validation tests

## üìö Historical Value

### What We Learned

**From gpu_dsl_core.py**:
- Individual operation GPU transfer overhead too high
- Batch processing is critical for GPU efficiency
- JIT warmup significantly affects first-run performance

**From gpu_env.py**:
- Auto-detection is more reliable than manual GPU selection
- Kaggle GPU types vary (T4x2, P100, L4x4) - need flexibility
- CPU fallback is essential for compatibility

**From gpu_ops_priority1.py**:
- Not all operations benefit from GPU (simple ops too fast)
- Target operations >5ms execution time
- Batch size 200 is optimal for single GPU

**From gpu_dsl_examples.py**:
- Simple examples help understanding
- But real-world validation tests are more valuable
- Production needs comprehensive test coverage

## üîç When to Reference

### For Historical Context
- Understanding evolution of GPU implementation
- Learning what approaches were tried and why they changed
- Reviewing early performance analysis

### For Code Archaeology
- Finding origin of certain design decisions
- Understanding experimental features
- Tracing bug fixes back to source

### Not for Production
‚ùå Do not use these files in production code  
‚úÖ Use current implementations in root directory

## üìä Development Timeline

### Week 1 (Early October)
- **gpu_dsl_core.py** created - first GPU operations
- **gpu_env.py** created - environment detection
- Individual operation approach tested

### Week 2 (Mid October)
- Pivot to batch processing approach
- **gpu_ops_priority1.py** - prioritized operations
- Performance validation on Kaggle

### Week 3 (Late October)
- Consolidated into **gpu_optimizations.py**
- Hybrid strategy developed
- Production implementation validated

### Archive (October 12)
- Experimental files superseded
- Production code validated (2.0-2.5x speedup)
- Moved to archive for reference

## üéì Key Takeaways

### 1. Iterate Quickly
These experimental files allowed rapid prototyping and testing of ideas without breaking production code.

### 2. Measure Everything
Early benchmarking revealed batch processing was critical - saved weeks of development time.

### 3. Consolidate When Stable
Once approach validated, consolidated experimental code into clean production implementation.

### 4. Archive, Don't Delete
Keeping experimental work provides valuable context for future development and onboarding.
