# GPU Acceleration Weeks 1-3 Archive

This directory contains historical documentation and test scripts from the GPU acceleration project (Weeks 1-3, completed October 11, 2025).

## Summary of Work

### Week 1: GPU o_g Implementation
- Implemented GPU-accelerated `o_g` operation
- Achieved 128/128 correctness on test suite
- Result: 1.86x speedup on 10×10 grids

### Week 2: Correctness Fix
- Discovered hash randomization causing non-deterministic frozenset iteration
- Fixed with ordered set() intermediate construction (Fix v4)
- Result: 100% correctness (3/3 solvers on Kaggle)

### Week 3: Hybrid CPU/GPU Strategy
- Implemented automatic CPU/GPU selection based on grid size
- 70-cell threshold: <70 uses CPU, ≥70 uses GPU
- Result: 100% correctness, validated on full ARC dataset

### Final Validation
- Analyzed 1000 ARC training tasks (8,616 grids)
- 65% of grids will benefit from GPU (≥70 cells)
- Expected 2.0-2.5x speedup on production workloads

## Key Insights

### 1. Hash Randomization Discovery (Week 2)
Python's hash randomization causes non-deterministic frozenset iteration order. Solution: Use `set()` as ordered intermediate when constructing frozensets from tuples.

### 2. Grid Size Distribution (Week 3)
Real ARC tasks have median 100 cells, mean 168 cells. 65% of grids are ≥70 cells, perfect for GPU acceleration.

### 3. Threshold Optimization (Week 3)
70-cell threshold is optimal - it's the natural split point where GPU overhead (0.2ms) transitions from dominating to negligible.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Test on real data** - Synthetic tests were unrepresentative
2. **Hash randomization matters** - Non-deterministic behavior can cause subtle bugs
3. **GPU overhead is real** - Only worth it when compute >> transfer time
4. **Hybrid strategies work** - Automatic selection beats pure GPU or CPU

## Next Steps (Week 4)

Ready to scale hybrid strategy to 20-50 additional solvers:
1. Profile solvers for average grid size
2. Convert high-value candidates (mean >100 cells)
3. Validate correctness per solver
4. Measure actual speedup on Kaggle

Expected result: 2.0-2.5x average speedup on full ARC benchmark.
