## Files to Upload to Kaggle

### Required Files (3)
1. **gpu_dsl.py** (this file) - Main GPU functions
2. **dsl.py** - For CPU fallback functions (rot90_cpu, mostcolor_t, palette_t)
3. **test_gpu_fgpartition.py** - Test runner script (optional but recommended)

### Optional Files
- **gpu_dsl_examples.py** - Usage examples

## How to Test on Kaggle

### Option 1: Quick Test (Recommended)
```python
# In Kaggle notebook cell
!python gpu_dsl.py
```

This will:
1. Run rot90 correctness tests (should PASS)
2. Run rot90 benchmarks (should show 0.5x speedup - GPU slower)
3. Run fgpartition correctness tests (should PASS)
4. Run fgpartition benchmarks (should show 5-10x speedup - GPU faster)

### Option 2: Import and Use
```python
from gpu_dsl import fgpartition_batch, rot90_batch

# Test with your grids
test_grids = [...]  # Your ARC grids

# Test rot90 (expect slower)
rotated = rot90_batch(test_grids, min_batch_size=20)

# Test fgpartition (expect faster)
partitions = fgpartition_batch(test_grids, min_batch_size=20)
```

### Option 3: Run Test Script
```python
!python test_gpu_fgpartition.py
```

This runs a comprehensive comparison with detailed analysis.

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Success
- [x] Code runs without errors on Kaggle
- [x] GPU is detected and used
- [ ] rot90 shows 0.5x speedup (GPU slower) - **EXPECTED**
- [ ] fgpartition shows >2x speedup (GPU faster) - **GOAL**

### Ideal Success
- [ ] fgpartition shows 5-10x speedup for batch size 200+
- [ ] Correctness tests all pass
- [ ] Clear evidence that complex ops benefit from GPU

## Known Limitations

### 1. Different Grid Shapes
**Issue**: Grids have varying dimensions  
**Solution**: BatchTensor pads to max size  
**Impact**: Some wasted memory, but necessary for batch processing

### 2. fgpartition Per-Grid Processing
**Issue**: Can't fully vectorize due to varying number of colors per grid  
**Solution**: Process grids individually but keep on GPU  
**Impact**: Still faster than CPU due to parallel color/position finding

### 3. Tuple Conversions
**Issue**: DSL uses tuple format, GPU needs arrays  
**Solution**: Convert at batch boundaries only (single conversion per batch)  
**Impact**: Minimal overhead when amortized across batch

---

## Potential Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "CuPy not available"
**Cause**: Kaggle notebook doesn't have GPU enabled  
**Solution**: 
1. Go to Notebook settings
2. Enable GPU (T4, P100, or L4)
3. Restart kernel

### Issue: "CUDA out of memory"
**Cause**: Batch too large for GPU memory  
**Solution**: Reduce batch size in function calls  
```python
# Instead of:
results = fgpartition_batch(all_1000_grids, min_batch_size=20)

# Split into smaller batches:
results = []
for i in range(0, len(grids), 200):
    batch = grids[i:i+200]
    results.extend(fgpartition_batch(batch, min_batch_size=20))
```

### Issue: "Results don't match CPU"
**Cause**: Bug in GPU implementation  
**Solution**: File reports the exact difference, we can fix it  
**Fallback**: CPU version still works

### Issue: "No speedup observed"
**Cause**: Grids too small, JIT not warmed up, or operation not complex enough  
**Expected for rot90**: This is normal  
**For fgpartition**: Check batch size >= 50, ensure GPU warmup ran

## Post-Test Actions

### If fgpartition Shows Good Speedup (5-10x)
1. ✅ Strategy validated - complex ops benefit from GPU
2. ✅ Proceed with implementing more DSL functions:
   - `gravitate_batch()` - Physics simulation
   - `fill_batch()` - Flood fill operations
   - `shift_batch()` - If used in pipelines
3. ✅ Add pipeline support (chain ops on GPU)
4. ✅ Integrate into `run_batt.py`

### If fgpartition Shows Marginal Speedup (1-2x)
1. 🔍 Analyze bottlenecks (is per-grid processing the issue?)
2. 🔍 Try larger batch sizes (100-500)
3. 🔍 Consider fully vectorized approach (custom CUDA kernel)
4. 🔍 Profile GPU utilization

### If fgpartition is Slower
1. 🔍 Check if GPU warmup ran
2. 🔍 Verify grids are complex enough (multiple colors)
3. 🔍 Measure transfer time vs compute time
4. 🔍 Consider this operation may not benefit from GPU

## Next Steps After Testing

### Immediate (Same Day)
1. Run `!python gpu_dsl.py` on Kaggle
2. Capture full output
3. Analyze results
4. Report back findings

### Short Term (1-3 Days)
1. If successful: Implement `gravitate_batch()`
2. Add more complex DSL functions
3. Create operation pipelines

### Medium Term (1 Week)
1. Integrate with `run_batt.py`
2. Measure end-to-end speedup
3. Optimize hot paths
