## üéØ Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Correctness:** All 3 solvers match CPU results exactly  
‚úÖ **Performance:** Average speedup ‚â• 1.5x  
‚úÖ **Consistency:** All 3 solvers show speedup (none slower)  

### Performance Targets

| Solver | Expected CPU | Expected GPU | Target Speedup |
|--------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| 23b5c85d | ~8ms | ~4-5ms | 1.7-2.0x |
| 09629e4f | ~7ms | ~3-4ms | 1.8-2.3x |
| 1f85a75f | ~5ms | ~2-3ms | 1.6-2.0x |
| **Average** | ~7ms | ~3-4ms | **1.7-2.1x** |

**Note:** These are end-to-end solver times, not just o_g times.

## üìä What to Report

Copy the full benchmark output, especially:

1. **Correctness status for each solver**
   - All should show `‚úì Results match`

2. **Performance table:**
   ```
   Solver       CPU (ms)   GPU (ms)   Speedup
   23b5c85d     X.XXX      X.XXX      X.XXx
   09629e4f     X.XXX      X.XXX      X.XXx
   1f85a75f     X.XXX      X.XXX      X.XXx
   AVERAGE      X.XXX      X.XXX      X.XXx
   ```

3. **Any errors or warnings**

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Import Errors
```python
# Check files are uploaded
!ls -la *.py

# Test imports manually
!python -c "from gpu_solvers_pre import GPU_SOLVERS; print(GPU_SOLVERS)"
!python -c "from solvers_pre import solve_23b5c85d; print('CPU OK')"
```

### Correctness Mismatch
- Report which solver failed
- Copy both CPU and GPU results
- May indicate bug in GPU implementation

### Performance Issues

**If speedup < 1.0 (GPU slower):**
- Check GPU is actually being used
- Verify CuPy is available
- May need grid size threshold

**If speedup 1.0-1.5x (marginal):**
- Still progress! Document actual numbers
- May indicate overhead in solver pipeline
- Consider optimizations in Week 3

**If some solvers fast, some slow:**
- Document which solvers work well
- May depend on grid size or o_g mode
- Focus Week 3 on successful patterns

## üìà Interpretation Guide

### Excellent (‚â•2.0x average)
‚Üí GPU acceleration highly effective  
‚Üí Proceed to Week 3/4  
‚Üí Scale to 10-20 more solvers  

### Good (1.5-2.0x average)
‚Üí Meaningful improvement achieved  
‚Üí Proceed to Week 3 with dual-return API  
‚Üí Focus on largest/slowest solvers  

### Marginal (1.2-1.5x average)
‚Üí Some benefit, but limited  
‚Üí Add grid size threshold (use CPU for small grids)  
‚Üí Profile to find bottlenecks  
‚Üí May need GPU-resident approach earlier  

### Poor (<1.2x average)
‚Üí GPU overhead too high for these solvers  
‚Üí Need significant optimization  
‚Üí Consider targeting only very complex solvers (>20ms)  
‚Üí May need to rethink strategy  

---

## üîÑ After Testing

### If Performance Good (‚â•1.5x)

1. ‚úÖ Week 2 Complete
2. Document actual speedups in `WEEK_2_RESULTS.md`
3. Update expectations for Week 3/4
4. Plan scaling to 10-20 solvers

### If Performance Marginal (1.2-1.5x)

1. Add grid size threshold optimization
2. Re-test with threshold
3. If improved, proceed to Week 3
4. If not, deeper profiling needed

### If Performance Poor (<1.2x)

1. Profile to identify bottlenecks
2. Check if o_g is actually being called
3. Verify test inputs are representative
4. May need different approach

## üí° Key Differences from Week 1

**Week 1:**
- Tested isolated `o_g` operation
- Small synthetic grids (3√ó3, 5√ó5)
- Showed 1.86x on realistic 10√ó10 grid

**Week 2:**
- Tests complete solver execution
- Real solver inputs (8√ó8 to 10√ó10)
- Includes all DSL operations, not just o_g
- More representative of production use

**Why Week 2 is critical:**
- Shows if o_g speedup translates to solver speedup
- Reveals overhead from other operations
- Tests real-world integration
- Validates the hybrid GPU strategy

---

## üìù Expected Learnings

From this benchmark, we'll learn:

1. **Does o_g dominance (75-92%) translate to end-to-end speedup?**
   - If yes: Strategy validated
   - If no: Other operations add overhead

2. **Are solver grids large enough for GPU benefit?**
   - Week 1 showed small grids hurt performance
   - Real solver grids should be larger

3. **Is 1.86x (Week 1 integration test) representative?**
   - Good indicator for Week 2 expectations
   - Actual solvers may be better or worse

4. **Do all solvers benefit equally?**
   - May find patterns (mode types, grid sizes)
   - Can guide Week 3/4 optimization

---

**Status:** Ready for Week 2 testing  
**Expected Outcome:** 1.5-2.1x end-to-end solver speedup  
**Confidence:** Moderate (based on Week 1 integration test showing 1.86x)  
**Impact:** Validates entire GPU acceleration strategy
