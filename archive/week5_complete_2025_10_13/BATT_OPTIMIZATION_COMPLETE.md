## üîë Key Optimizations

### 1. Phase 1: Body Hash Deduplication (0.015s)
**Problem**: 149 candidates with many duplicates  
**Solution**: MD5 hash of solver body before expensive operations  
**Result**: 149 ‚Üí 32 unique candidates instantly  
**Code**: `hashlib.md5(solver_body.encode()).hexdigest()`

### 2. Phase 2: Parallel Inline Processing (0.618s)
**Problem**: Sequential `inline_variables()` taking ~2s  
**Solution**: ThreadPoolExecutor with 4 workers for batch processing  
**Result**: 2s ‚Üí 0.6s (3.3x faster)  
**Code**: 
```python
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(inline_one_solver, data) for data in candidate_data]
    inlined_data = [f.result() for f in as_completed(futures)]
```

### 3. Phase 3: Parallel Validation (0.379s)
**Problem**: Sequential solver validation taking ~14s  
**Solution**: `asyncio.gather()` for parallel validation  
**Result**: 14s ‚Üí 0.379s (37x faster)  
**Code**:
```python
async def check_one_solver(data):
    timed_out = await check_solver_speed(...)
    return {**data, 'timed_out': timed_out, 'check_time': check_time}

validated_data = await asyncio.gather(*[check_one_solver(d) for d in inlined_data])
```

### 4. Phase 4B: Match-Only Diff Calls (1.461s - Critical!)
**Problem**: Calling `batt()` diff for ALL 160 outputs (23s wasted)  
**Solution**: Only call diff for matching outputs  
**Result**: 160 ‚Üí 5 diff calls (97% reduction), 25.162s ‚Üí 1.461s (17x faster!)  
**Code**:
```python
# BEFORE: Always call diff
for output in demo_o:
    diff_result = call_with_timeout(batt, [...], timeout)

# AFTER: Only for matches
for output in demo_o:
    if match:  # Only call if output is correct
        diff_result = call_with_timeout(batt, [...], timeout)
```

**Impact**: This single change provided **3x speedup** on its own!

## üöß Challenges Overcome

### Challenge 1: ThreadPool Deadlock (Phase 4A Initial)
**Symptom**: `asyncio.gather()` with nested ThreadPoolExecutor caused deadlock  
**Root Cause**: High-level async trying to use low-level thread pool already saturated  
**Solution**: Pure threading approach with `call_with_timeout()` using Queue and Thread.join()

### Challenge 2: Timeout Too Short (Phase 4A)
**Symptom**: 28.161s total time despite parallel execution  
**Root Cause**: `timeout=1` for operations taking 2-3s ‚Üí all calls timing out  
**Solution**: Increased to `timeout=5` and removed double-timeout on `future.result()`

### Challenge 3: Unnecessary Diff Calls (Phase 4B)
**Symptom**: 25.162s in demo parallel execution  
**Root Cause**: Calling `batt()` diff for all 160 outputs, but only 5 matched  
**Solution**: Only call diff for matching outputs ‚Üí 97% reduction

## üí° Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Profile with Granularity
Initial profiling showed "parallel execution slow" but didn't reveal the nested loop was calling batt() 160 times. Always drill down into hot paths.

### 2. Question Assumptions
"Need diff for all outputs" seemed reasonable but was wrong. Only correct solutions need detailed analysis. Challenge every expensive operation.

### 3. Parallel ‚â† Fast
Phase 4A had 5-way parallelism but was still slow because each worker made 32 sequential calls. Parallelism at the wrong level doesn't help.

### 4. CPU Time vs Wall-Clock
`check_solver_speed: 7.173s` is the sum of parallel operations (CPU time), not wall-clock time. Use `asyncio.gather()` or ThreadPoolExecutor timing for real metrics.

### 5. Small Changes, Big Impact
The match-only optimization was a 3-line change that delivered 3x speedup. Always look for the highest-leverage improvements.

## üîÆ Future Optimization Opportunities

While the current 4.06x speedup meets all goals, further improvements are possible:

### 1. Score Aggregation (~2.5s)
The remaining time in `check_batt` after demo/test scoring is score aggregation:
```python
for result in demo_results:
    for output in result['outputs']:
        o_score.update(...)  # Could batch these
        d_score.update(...)
```
**Potential**: 30-50% reduction with batch updates

### 2. Inline Variables (1.975s)
Still the largest single component. AST visiting takes 1.713s:
```python
utils.inline_variables.visit:   1.713s (87% of inline time)
```
**Potential**: Cache AST parsing, optimize visitor pattern

### 3. Test Sample Scoring
Apply match-only optimization to test samples (currently 0.079s, so low priority)

### 4. GPU Acceleration
Some operations might benefit from GPU acceleration (see GPU docs)

## üéì Usage Guide

### Running Optimized Batt

```bash
# Single task with timing
python run_batt.py --timing -i 007bbfb7 -b tmp_batt_onerun_run

# Expected output:
# Timing summary (seconds):
#   main.run_batt                       5.359
#   batt.demo.parallel                  1.461
#   -- Demo scoring: 160 outputs, 5 matches, 5 diff calls (skipped 155)
```

### Key Parameters

- `--timing`: Enable comprehensive profiling
- `-i TASK_ID`: Specific task to process
- `-b BATCH_FILE`: Batch file for solver candidates
- `timeout=5`: Timeout for batt() calls (tuned for 2-3s operations)

### Understanding Output

```
-- Demo scoring: 160 outputs, 5 matches, 5 diff calls (skipped 155)
```
- **160 outputs**: Total solver outputs generated
- **5 matches**: Correct outputs (1 per demo sample)
- **5 diff calls**: Actual batt() calls made (match-only optimization)
- **skipped 155**: Diff calls avoided (97% reduction)
