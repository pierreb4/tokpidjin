# Kaggle Deployment Issue - No GPU Context Activation

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Status**: 🔴 INVESTIGATING

## Problem

After uploading files to Kaggle and running `kaggle_gpu_benchmark.py`, the GPU context is NOT being activated:

- ❌ No "🔥 GPU-aware context activated" log
- ❌ No "GPU mapply: func_name" logs  
- ❌ No "batch_mapply: Processing on GPU" logs
- ❌ Parallel is **SLOWER** than sequential (0.58x vs 1.0x)
- ✅ MultiGPUOptimizer initializes correctly (4/4 GPUs)

## Most Likely Cause

**`batch_dsl_context.py` was not uploaded to Kaggle dataset**

This is a **NEW** file created in Week 5 Day 3 Phase 6 (today). It's the critical integration layer that makes GPU operations work.

## Why This File Is Critical

Without `batch_dsl_context.py`:
1. Import fails in `mega_batch_batt.py` line 234
2. GPU context manager never activates
3. DSL functions never get wrapped
4. All DSL calls go to CPU (dsl.py)
5. GPU operations never called
6. Same symptoms as before GPU integration was implemented

## File Details

- **Location (local)**: `/Users/pierre/dsl/tokpidjin/batch_dsl_context.py`
- **Size**: 217 lines, ~8,000 bytes
- **Created**: Week 5 Day 3, Phase 6
- **Purpose**: Monkey-patches DSL functions to route to GPU
- **Status locally**: ✅ Verified present
- **Status on Kaggle**: ❓ Unknown (likely MISSING)

## Diagnostic Steps

### Step 1: Run Diagnostic Script on Kaggle

Upload and run `check_kaggle_import.py` on Kaggle:

```python
!python /kaggle/input/tokpidjin/check_kaggle_import.py
```

This will show:
- ✅ Files in Kaggle dataset
- ✅ Whether batch_dsl_context.py is present
- ✅ File size (should be ~8KB)
- ✅ Whether import succeeds

**Expected Output if File Missing**:
```
❌ batch_dsl_context.py NOT FOUND in dataset
   This is why GPU context is not activating!
   Action: Upload batch_dsl_context.py to Kaggle dataset
```

**Expected Output if File Present**:
```
✅ batch_dsl_context.py IS present in dataset
   Size: 8,152 bytes
   ✓ File size looks correct
✅ batch_dsl_context imported successfully!
```

### Step 2: Check Kaggle Dataset Directly

1. Go to: `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/[your-username]/tokpidjin`
2. Look at file list in the dataset
3. Search for: `batch_dsl_context.py`
4. Check size: Should be ~8KB (217 lines)

### Step 3: Upload Missing File (If Needed)

If file is missing:

1. Go to Kaggle dataset
2. Click "New Version"
3. Upload `batch_dsl_context.py` from local machine
4. Save new version
5. Wait for dataset version to be ready
6. Re-run `kaggle_gpu_benchmark.py`

### Step 4: Verify Success

After uploading, you should see these logs in benchmark output:

```
🔥 GPU-aware context activated for batch processing
Installed GPU-aware DSL wrappers
GPU mapply: rot90 on 4 items
batch_mapply: Processing 4 grids on GPU (multi-GPU: 4 GPUs)
Batch complete: 12/15 operations used GPU (80%)
```

And performance should improve:
```
sequential:    0.4s  (1.0x)
parallel_gpu:  0.15s (2.7x)  ← 2-4x speedup!
```

## Evidence This Is The Problem

1. **File is NEW**: Created today in Phase 6, easy to miss during upload
2. **Code present locally**: Verified in mega_batch_batt.py line 234
3. **No import error shown**: Import wrapped in try/except, fails silently
4. **Same symptoms as before**: Parallel slower (0.58x), no GPU benefit
5. **User's intuition**: "Not sure that the code for option 1 is in yet"
6. **All other signs work**: MultiGPUOptimizer initializes (GPU system ready)

## What The Code Should Do

### mega_batch_batt.py (line 219-250)

```python
def process_batch(self, batch, batch_idx):
    # Try to import batch context for GPU-aware DSL operations
    batch_context = None
    if self.enable_gpu:
        try:
            from batch_dsl_context import batch_dsl_context  # ← Line 234
            batch_context = batch_dsl_context(gpu_ops=self.gpu_ops, enable_gpu=True)
            logger.info("🔥 GPU-aware context activated for batch processing")
            # ↑ Should see this log!
        except ImportError as e:
            logger.warning(f"⚠️  batch_dsl_context not available: {e}")
            logger.warning("⚠️  GPU operations will NOT be used (Option 1 not active)")
            # ↑ If file missing, should see this log!
```

### batch_dsl_context.py (what it does)

```python
class BatchContext:
    def wrap_mapply(self, original_mapply):
        def gpu_aware_mapply(func, collection):
            if self.should_use_gpu(collection):
                # Route to GPU batch operation
                result = self.gpu_ops.batch_mapply([collection], func)
                logger.debug(f"GPU mapply: {func.__name__}")  # ← Log!
                return result[0]
            return original_mapply(func, collection)
        return gpu_aware_mapply
    
    def install_wrappers(self):
        import dsl
        self.original_functions['mapply'] = dsl.mapply
        dsl.mapply = self.wrap_mapply(dsl.mapply)  # ← Monkey-patch!
        logger.info("Installed GPU-aware DSL wrappers")  # ← Log!
```

## Expected Logs by Scenario

### Scenario A: File Missing (CURRENT STATE)
```
MultiGPUOptimizer initialized with 4/4 GPUs  ← Only this appears
                                             ← No GPU context logs!
sequential:    0.392s (1.0x)
parallel_cpu:  0.676s (0.58x - SLOWER)
parallel_gpu:  0.726s (0.54x - NO BENEFIT)
```

### Scenario B: Import Error
```
MultiGPUOptimizer initialized with 4/4 GPUs
⚠️  batch_dsl_context not available: No module named 'batch_dsl_context'
⚠️  GPU operations will NOT be used (Option 1 not active)
sequential:    0.392s (1.0x)
parallel_cpu:  0.676s (0.58x - SLOWER)
```

### Scenario C: Success (EXPECTED)
```
MultiGPUOptimizer initialized with 4/4 GPUs
🔥 GPU-aware context activated for batch processing
Installed GPU-aware DSL wrappers
GPU mapply: rot90 on 4 items
batch_mapply: Processing 4 grids on GPU
Batch complete: 12/15 operations used GPU (80%)
sequential:    0.4s  (1.0x)
parallel_gpu:  0.15s (2.7x - SUCCESS!)
```

## Timeline

- **13:30**: Implemented Option 1, created batch_dsl_context.py
- **14:00**: Verified all files present locally (including batch_dsl_context.py)
- **14:04**: Committed and announced ready for deployment
- **14:05-14:30**: User uploaded files to Kaggle (exact timing unknown)
- **14:30**: User ran benchmark - NO GPU context activation
- **14:35**: Started investigating (current time)

**Key Question**: Did user upload files BEFORE 13:30? (before batch_dsl_context.py was created)

## Files Required on Kaggle

### 🔴 CRITICAL (GPU Integration)
- ✅ `batch_dsl_context.py` (217 lines, 8KB) ← **VERIFY THIS ONE!**
- ✅ `gpu_dsl_operations.py` (504 lines, 20KB)
- ✅ `mega_batch_batt.py` (473 lines, 20KB)

### 🟡 REQUIRED (Dependencies)
- ✅ `gpu_optimizations.py` (508 lines, 24KB)
- ✅ `dsl.py` (3734 lines, 100KB)
- ✅ `safe_dsl.py` (186 lines, 8KB)
- ✅ `arc_types.py` (47 lines, 4KB)
- ✅ `batt_gpu_operations_test.py` (67 lines, 4KB)
- ✅ `kaggle_gpu_benchmark.py` (324 lines, 12KB)

## Next Actions

1. **IMMEDIATE** (5 min): Run `check_kaggle_import.py` on Kaggle
2. **IF MISSING** (5 min): Upload `batch_dsl_context.py`
3. **VERIFY** (5 min): Re-run `kaggle_gpu_benchmark.py`
4. **SUCCESS** (30 min): Document 2-4x speedup achieved

**Expected total time to fix**: 15-45 minutes

## Success Criteria

When fixed, you'll see:
- ✅ "🔥 GPU-aware context activated" log
- ✅ "Installed GPU-aware DSL wrappers" log
- ✅ "GPU mapply: func_name" logs for operations
- ✅ "batch_mapply: Processing on GPU" logs
- ✅ Speedup >= 2.0x (expected 2-4x)
- ✅ No crashes or errors

## References

- **Implementation**: `batch_dsl_context.py` (Week 5 Day 3 Phase 6)
- **Integration**: `mega_batch_batt.py` lines 219-250
- **Documentation**: `GPU_INTEGRATION_PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS.md`
- **Strategy**: `FINAL_DECISION_GPU_INTEGRATION.md`
- **Deployment**: `KAGGLE_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
- **Diagnostic**: `check_kaggle_import.py` (NEW)

---

**Bottom Line**: The most likely problem is that `batch_dsl_context.py` was not uploaded to Kaggle. Run the diagnostic script to confirm, then upload the file if missing. This should fix the issue and give 2-4x speedup.
