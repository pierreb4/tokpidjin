# GPU Integration Options - Performance & Flexibility Analysis

## Performance Comparison

### Option 1: Monkey-Patch DSL Functions
**Expected Performance: 2-4x speedup**

```python
# Intercepts individual DSL calls
t1 = mapply(rot90, S)  # ‚Üí GPU wrapper checks, routes to GPU
```

**Performance characteristics:**
- ‚úÖ GPU batch operation per DSL call (batch_mapply, batch_o_g, etc.)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Each call transfers data GPU ‚Üî CPU independently
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No cross-call optimization
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Thread-local context overhead on every call

**Bottleneck**: Data transfer overhead dominates for small operations
- Transfer S to GPU (0.1-0.5ms)
- Process rot90 on GPU (0.05ms)
- Transfer result back (0.1-0.5ms)
- **Total: 0.25-1.0ms** vs CPU 0.1ms = **SLOWER** for small ops!

Only wins when:
- Operations are compute-heavy (o_g, fill, gravitate)
- Batch size is large (>100 grids)
- Multiple operations can stay on GPU (not yet implemented)

---

### Option 2: Batch Transformation
**Expected Performance: 5-10x speedup** ‚≠ê

```python
# Collects operations from entire batch
Batch of 20 tasks:
  Task 1: t1 = mapply(rot90, S)
  Task 2: t1 = mapply(rot90, S)
  ...
  Task 20: t1 = mapply(rot90, S)

# Executes as:
all_S = [S1, S2, ..., S20]  # 20 * 4 samples = 80 grids
result = batch_mapply(all_S, rot90)  # Single GPU call for 80 grids!
```

**Performance characteristics:**
- ‚úÖ‚úÖ Single GPU transfer for entire batch (80 grids)
- ‚úÖ‚úÖ Amortizes transfer overhead across batch
- ‚úÖ‚úÖ GPU parallelism scales with batch size
- ‚úÖ Can optimize across multiple operations

**Speedup calculation:**
```
CPU Sequential: 80 grids √ó 0.1ms = 8ms
GPU Batch:
  Transfer to GPU: 0.5ms (once for all 80)
  Process 80 on GPU: 0.2ms (parallel)
  Transfer back: 0.5ms
  Total: 1.2ms
  
Speedup: 8ms / 1.2ms = 6.7x
```

**Why this is best:**
1. Transfer overhead becomes negligible (1ms / 80 grids = 0.0125ms per grid)
2. GPU parallelism maxed out with large batch
3. Can keep data GPU-resident across operations

---

### Option 3: Native Batch Batt
**Expected Performance: 10-15x speedup** ‚≠ê‚≠ê

```python
# Batt function works on entire batch natively
def batt_batch(task_ids, Ss, Is, Cs, log_paths):
    # All samples in one call
    t1s = batch_mapply(rot90, Ss)  # 80 grids, single transfer
    t2s = batch_mapply(flip, t1s)  # Result stays on GPU!
    t3s = batch_o_g(t2s, 0)        # Still on GPU!
    # ...
```

**Performance characteristics:**
- ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ Single transfer to GPU at start
- ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ All operations GPU-resident (no intermediate transfers)
- ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ Optimal GPU utilization
- ‚úÖ‚úÖ Can pipeline operations

**Speedup calculation:**
```
CPU Sequential: 80 grids √ó 10 ops √ó 0.1ms = 80ms
GPU Batch Pipeline:
  Transfer to GPU: 0.5ms (once)
  10 operations on GPU: 2ms (all GPU-resident)
  Transfer back: 0.5ms
  Total: 3ms
  
Speedup: 80ms / 3ms = 26.7x
```

**Why this is ultimate:**
1. Zero intermediate transfers (data stays on GPU)
2. Operation pipelining opportunities
3. Can use GPU streams for parallelism
4. Batch size can be very large (200+ samples)

---

### Option 4: Real Batt Files (batt_mega_test.py)
**Expected Performance: 3-4x speedup (parallel CPU only)**

```python
# Existing 3435-line batt, parallel processing
coordinator = MegaBatchCoordinator(
    batt_module_name='batt_mega_test',  # Complex real batt
    parallel=True,
    max_workers=4
)
```

**Performance characteristics:**
- ‚úÖ Parallel CPU processing works well
- ‚úÖ Real workload (50 tasks, complex operations)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Still no GPU acceleration (needs Option 1, 2, or 3)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è GIL limits true parallelism

This is just baseline parallel - needs GPU integration!

## Flexibility Comparison

### Option 1: Monkey-Patch
**Flexibility: HIGH** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ No changes to dsl.py
- ‚úÖ No changes to batt files
- ‚úÖ No changes to batt generation
- ‚úÖ Works with any existing code
- ‚úÖ Easy to add new operations (just wrap them)
- ‚úÖ Can disable per-operation
- ‚úÖ Automatic fallback to CPU

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Global state (thread-local context)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential threading issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Harder to debug (indirection)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Wrapper overhead on every call

**Changes required to dsl.py:** NONE ‚úÖ

**Impact of dsl.py changes:**
- New functions: Just add new wrappers
- Function signature changes: Update wrapper
- Renamed functions: Update wrapper name
- **Minimal coupling!**

---

### Option 2: Batch Transformation
**Flexibility: MEDIUM** ‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ No changes to dsl.py
- ‚úÖ No changes to batt files
- ‚úÖ Can optimize across operations
- ‚úÖ Automatic batching detection

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex execution tracing needed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Must track operation dependencies
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Harder to debug (deferred execution)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires operation buffering/replay

**Changes required to dsl.py:** NONE ‚úÖ

**Impact of dsl.py changes:**
- New functions: Add to trace capture
- Side effects: May break tracing
- Control flow: Difficult to capture
- **Moderate coupling**

---

### Option 3: Native Batch Batt
**Flexibility: LOW** ‚≠ê

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Cleanest implementation
- ‚úÖ Maximum performance
- ‚úÖ No runtime overhead
- ‚úÖ Easy to debug (explicit)

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Requires batt generation changes
- ‚ùå All batt files must be regenerated
- ‚ùå Two versions of DSL (single vs batch)
- ‚ùå Cannot use existing batt files

**Changes required to dsl.py:** Create batch versions of all functions

**Impact of dsl.py changes:**
- New functions: Add both single AND batch version
- Function changes: Update both versions
- Breaking changes: Breaks all generated batts
- **High coupling!**

---

## Recommendation: Hybrid Approach

### Phase 1: Monkey-Patch (IMMEDIATE - 2-3 hours)
**Goal: Validate GPU operations work at all**

‚úÖ Implement Option 1 now (already done!)
- Test on Kaggle with batt_gpu_operations_test.py
- Verify GPU operations are called
- Measure actual speedup (expect 2-3x)
- Proves the concept works

### Phase 2: Smart Batching (Week 6 - 1-2 days)
**Goal: Optimize for real performance**

Enhance Option 1 with batch collection:
```python
class BatchContext:
    def __init__(self):
        self.operation_buffer = []  # Collect operations
        self.batch_threshold = 10   # Batch after N ops
        
    def wrap_mapply(self, original):
        def smart_mapply(func, collection):
            # Buffer the operation
            self.operation_buffer.append(('mapply', func, collection))
            
            # Execute batch when threshold reached
            if len(self.operation_buffer) >= self.batch_threshold:
                self.flush_batch()
            
            # Return result from batch execution
            return self.get_result()
```

This gives us:
- ‚úÖ Flexibility of Option 1 (no code changes)
- ‚úÖ Performance approaching Option 2 (batching)
- ‚úÖ Easy to tune (batch threshold, buffer size)

### Phase 3: Selective Native Batch (Future - Optional)
**Goal: Maximum performance for hot paths**

For the most critical operations (top 5% by time):
- Generate native batch versions (Option 3)
- Keep monkey-patch for everything else (Option 1)
- Best of both worlds!
