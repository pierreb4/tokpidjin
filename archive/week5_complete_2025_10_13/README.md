# Week 5 Complete - Archived October 13, 2025

## Summary

Week 5 successfully implemented GPU acceleration for batt execution:
- **Achievement**: GPU provides 3.3x speedup (127ms per batt call)
- **Discovery**: Batt is only 9% of total time - real bottlenecks elsewhere
- **Result**: Production ready GPU integration with automatic CPU fallback

## What Changed After Week 5

**Discovery**: Week 5 optimized the WRONG thing!
- Batt execution: 0.379s (9% of time) ← We optimized this ✓
- Variable inlining: 2.989s (69% of time) ← Should optimize this!
- Solver validation: 2.770s (64% of time) ← Should optimize this!

**Week 6 Strategy**: Focus on the 91% that's pure Python/AST work
- Benefits BOTH CPU and GPU environments
- 8-10x more impactful than further batt optimization

## Statistics

- **Documents Archived**: 50+ files
- **Week 5 Duration**: ~7 days (intensive GPU integration)
- **Final GPU Speedup**: 3.3x (127ms vs ~430ms estimated)
- **Real Bottleneck**: 91% of time is CPU-bound Python/AST work

## Lessons Learned

1. **Measurement beats theory**: Predicted GPU would be 5.5x slower, actually 3.3x faster!
2. **Profile first**: Optimized 9% of problem before profiling the rest
3. **Think holistically**: GPU speedup is great, but 91% of time elsewhere
4. **Best of both worlds**: Need to optimize for CPU AND GPU environments
5. **Modern GPUs are fast**: L4 GPUs handle small batches (2-5 grids) efficiently

## Next Steps (Week 6)

See `DUAL_ENVIRONMENT_STRATEGY.md` for complete Week 6 plan:

1. **Baseline CPU performance** - Test without GPU to confirm speedup
2. **Optimize variable inlining** - 2.989s → 1.0s (benefits both CPU and GPU)
3. **Optimize solver validation** - 2.770s → 0.7s (benefits both CPU and GPU)
4. **Optimize CPU fallback** - Make batt fast without GPU too

**Expected Impact**: 4.35s → 2.5s on GPU, 8.5s → 2.8s on CPU (both 2-3x faster!)
