# Week 5 Day 3 - GPU Operations Diagnosis

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Status**: üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND  
**Kaggle Result**: 2.99x (GPU) vs 2.98x (CPU Parallel) - **NO GPU ACCELERATION**

---

## Executive Summary

The Kaggle benchmark revealed that **GPU operations are not actually using the GPU**. The code initializes `MultiGPUOptimizer` but never calls it. All "GPU" operations just call CPU DSL functions directly.

**Result**: GPU performance = CPU parallel performance (2.99x vs 2.98x)  
**Cause**: Implementation bug - GPU optimizer initialized but not used  
**Impact**: No GPU acceleration, 3-4x slower than expected (7-12x target)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem: GPU Optimizer Never Called

Looking at `gpu_dsl_operations.py`:

#### batch_o_g (Line ~158):
```python
def batch_o_g(self, grids: List[Grid], rotations: List[int]) -> List[FrozenSet]:
    # ... initialization code ...
    
    # GPU implementation using batch processing pattern
    import cupy as cp
    from dsl import o_g  # ‚Üê Importing CPU function!
    
    # ... GPU transfer code ...
    
    # Process each grid
    for j, (grid, rotation, gpu_arr) in enumerate(zip(batch_grids, batch_rotations, gpu_arrays)):
        # Transfer back for complex operations
        cpu_grid = cp.asnumpy(gpu_arr)
        grid_tuple = tuple(tuple(row) for row in cpu_grid)
        
        # Use existing o_g logic (already optimized)
        result = o_g(grid_tuple, rotation)  # ‚Üê CALLING CPU FUNCTION!
        batch_results.append(result)
```

**Issue**: We transfer grids to GPU, then immediately transfer back and call CPU `o_g()`!

#### batch_mapply (Line ~185):
```python
def batch_mapply(self, func: Callable, grid_lists: List[tuple]) -> List[tuple]:
    # ... code ...
    
    # For simple functions, process in batch
    if func_name in ['identity', 'rot90', 'rot180', 'rot270', 'flip', 'transpose', 'p_g']:
        # Process all grids (DSL functions already optimized)
        processed = [func(grid) for grid in flat_grids]  # ‚Üê CALLING CPU FUNCTIONS!
```

**Issue**: We check GPU compatibility, then call CPU DSL functions directly!

#### batch_apply (Line ~235):
```python
def batch_apply(self, func: Callable, sample_lists: List[tuple]) -> List[tuple]:
    # ... code ...
    
    # For first/second extraction, process in parallel
    if func_name in ['first', 'second', 'get_nth_t']:
        results = []
        for samples in sample_lists:
            result = apply(func, samples)  # ‚Üê CALLING CPU FUNCTION!
```

**Issue**: We check function name, then call CPU `apply()` directly!

### What We're NOT Doing

The `MultiGPUOptimizer` has these methods we should be using:
```python
# From gpu_optimizations.py:
class MultiGPUOptimizer:
    def batch_grid_op_optimized(self, grids, operation_vectorized, 
                                vectorized=True, operation_single=None):
        """Process batch of grids on multiple GPUs"""
        # ... actual GPU processing code ...
```

**We never call this!** We initialize the optimizer but never use it.

---

## Why Local Validation Showed 3.78x

Local validation script used **mock data** (3 samples):
```python
# From validate_local.py:
grid1 = ((0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0))
grid2 = ((1, 1, 1), (1, 0, 1), (1, 1, 1))

mock_data = {
    'demo': {'task1': [{'input': grid1, 'output': grid2}] * 10},
    'test': {'task1': [{'input': grid1, 'output': None}] * 10}
}
```

This data was too simple - `batt_mega_test` didn't call the complex DSL operations. The 3.78x was purely from **parallel ThreadPoolExecutor**, not GPU!

Kaggle test (20 samples) was also too simple - same result (2.98x parallel).

---

## The Correct Architecture

From the original GPU optimization docs (copilot-instructions.md):

### What SHOULD Happen:

```python
# In batch_o_g:
def batch_o_g(self, grids: List[Grid], rotations: List[int]) -> List[FrozenSet]:
    if not self.enable_gpu or len(grids) < 5:
        return [o_g(grid, rotation) for grid, rotation in zip(grids, rotations)]
    
    # CORRECT: Use GPU optimizer for grid operations
    try:
        # Define vectorized operation for GPU
        def rotate_and_extract_vectorized(gpu_grids):
            """Process batch on GPU"""
            # Apply rotations on GPU
            rotated = self._apply_rotations_gpu(gpu_grids, rotations)
            # Extract objects on GPU (or transfer back if too complex)
            return rotated
        
        # USE THE GPU OPTIMIZER!
        results = self.gpu_opt.batch_grid_op_optimized(
            grids=grids,
            operation_vectorized=rotate_and_extract_vectorized,
            vectorized=True
        )
        
        return results
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"GPU batch_o_g failed: {e}, falling back to CPU")
        return [o_g(grid, rotation) for grid, rotation in zip(grids, rotations)]
```

### What We're ACTUALLY Doing:

```python
# WRONG: Transfer to GPU then immediately back to CPU
gpu_arr = cp.asarray(grid)
cpu_grid = cp.asnumpy(gpu_arr)  # ‚Üê Why did we even transfer to GPU?
result = o_g(cpu_grid, rotation)  # ‚Üê CPU function!
```

---

## Impact Analysis

### Current Performance
- **Sequential**: 0.627s (1.0x baseline)
- **Parallel CPU**: 0.210s (2.98x) ‚Üê From ThreadPoolExecutor
- **Parallel GPU**: 0.209s (2.99x) ‚Üê SAME as CPU (no GPU benefit)

### Expected Performance (If GPU Actually Used)
Based on `gpu_optimizations.py` benchmarks:
- **L4 x4 GPUs**: 9.35x single GPU, ~35x with 4 GPUs (multi-GPU)
- **T4 x2 GPUs**: 9.69x single GPU, ~18x with 2 GPUs
- **P100**: 7.64x single GPU

For our case (L4 x4):
- Sequential: 0.627s
- **Expected GPU**: 0.627s / (2.98x √ó 3x GPU) = **0.070s (~9x total)**
- **Expected Multi-GPU**: 0.627s / (2.98x √ó 10x) = **0.021s (~30x total)**

**We're leaving 3-10x performance on the table!**

## Fix Strategy

### Phase 1: Route Grid Operations Through GPU Optimizer (HIGH PRIORITY)

1. **Update batch_o_g**:
   ```python
   def batch_o_g(self, grids, rotations):
       if not self.enable_gpu or len(grids) < 5:
           return [o_g(g, r) for g, r in zip(grids, rotations)]
       
       # Define GPU-compatible operation
       def process_on_gpu(gpu_grids):
           # Implement rotation + object extraction on GPU
           # OR: Do rotation on GPU, object extraction on CPU
           pass
       
       # USE GPU OPTIMIZER
       return self.gpu_opt.batch_grid_op_optimized(
           grids=grids,
           operation_vectorized=process_on_gpu,
           vectorized=True
       )
   ```

2. **Update batch_mapply**:
   ```python
   def batch_mapply(self, func, grid_lists):
       # For GPU-compatible functions (p_g, rot90, etc.)
       if func_name in GPU_COMPATIBLE_FUNCS:
           return self.gpu_opt.batch_grid_op_optimized(
               grids=flat_grids,
               operation_vectorized=lambda x: apply_func_gpu(x, func),
               vectorized=True
           )
   ```

3. **Update batch_apply**:
   ```python
   def batch_apply(self, func, sample_lists):
       # Use GPU for extraction if batch is large enough
       if len(sample_lists) >= 20:
           return self.gpu_opt.batch_grid_op_optimized(...)
   ```

### Phase 2: Test and Validate

1. **Add GPU usage logging**:
   ```python
   logger.info(f"batch_o_g: Processing {len(grids)} grids on GPU")
   logger.info(f"GPU optimizer: {type(self.gpu_opt).__name__}")
   ```

2. **Re-run Kaggle benchmark**:
   - Should see 7-12x with correct GPU usage
   - L4 x4 could achieve 20-30x with multi-GPU

3. **Profile GPU utilization**:
   ```python
   # Add to benchmark
   !nvidia-smi dmon -s u
   ```

### Phase 3: Multi-GPU Optimization

Once single GPU works (7-12x):
1. Enable `MultiGPUOptimizer` for large batches (>100 grids)
2. Test scaling efficiency (should be 85-90%)
3. Target: 20-30x with 4 GPUs

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
1. **Assumed GPU was being used** - Should have verified with logging
2. **Test data too simple** - Mock data didn't trigger complex operations
3. **No GPU utilization monitoring** - Should have checked `nvidia-smi`
4. **Copy-paste without understanding** - Initialized optimizer but never called it

### How to Avoid Next Time
1. ‚úÖ **Add explicit logging**: "Processing on GPU" / "Using CPU fallback"
2. ‚úÖ **Monitor GPU usage**: Check `nvidia-smi` during benchmark
3. ‚úÖ **Test with real data**: Use actual batt solver code, not mock data
4. ‚úÖ **Verify speedup matches expectations**: 2.99x ‚â† 7-12x ‚Üí investigate!
5. ‚úÖ **Profile before and after**: Ensure GPU code paths are actually executed

## Confidence Level

**Fix Strategy**: ‚úÖ High confidence
