# GPU Integration Status - October 10, 2025

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Infrastructure Complete

### What's Working

1. **GPUEnv Class** (`gpu_env.py`) ‚úÖ
   - Drop-in replacement for `Env`
   - Transparent GPU usage with CPU fallback
   - Transfer manager to minimize CPU‚ÜîGPU transfers
   - Statistics tracking (GPU ops, CPU ops, timing, transfers)
   - Automatic cleanup of GPU memory

2. **Integration with card.py** ‚úÖ
   ```python
   # Line 696 in card.py
   from gpu_env import GPUEnv as Env
   
   # Line 701 in generated batt.py
   env = Env(seed, task_id, S, log_path)  # Uses GPUEnv!
   ```

3. **Generated batt.py Files** ‚úÖ
   - All generated files now use `GPUEnv` automatically
   - Example: `tmp_batt_onerun_run.py` line 4
   - No changes needed to existing generation logic

### Current Architecture

```
run_card.sh
    ‚Üì
card.py (generates batt.py with GPUEnv)
    ‚Üì
batt.py (uses env = GPUEnv(...))
    ‚Üì
run_batt.py (executes batt() function)
    ‚Üì
pile.py (env.do_pile() with GPU support)
```

## üîÑ Phase 2: GPU Operations (IN PROGRESS)

### What's Missing

The `GPUEnv` infrastructure is ready but **no GPU operations are registered yet**:

```python
# In gpu_env.py line 127
def _register_gpu_operations(self):
    """Register available GPU operations"""
    # Will be populated in future phases
    # For now, this is a placeholder
    pass  # ‚Üê EMPTY!
```

### Next Steps

#### Step 1: Profile to Identify Heavy Operations (PRIORITY 1)

Run profiler to find which DSL operations make solvers slow:

```bash
# On Kaggle with GPU
python profile_solvers.py

# Expected output:
# solve_36d67576 (120ms total):
#   - o_g:         45.2ms (37.5%) ‚Üê GPU TARGET
#   - fgpartition: 28.7ms (23.8%) ‚Üê GPU TARGET
#   - gravitate:   15.3ms (12.7%) ‚Üê GPU TARGET
#   - others:      31.5ms (26.0%)
```

#### Step 2: Create GPU Versions of Heavy Operations

Based on profiling results, create GPU-accelerated versions:

```python
# Create dsl_gpu.py
import cupy as cp

def o_g_gpu(grid_gpu, direction_gpu):
    """GPU-accelerated o_g operation"""
    # Vectorized CuPy operations
    # Keep result on GPU
    return result_gpu

def fgpartition_gpu(grid_gpu):
    """GPU-accelerated fgpartition"""
    # Connected components on GPU
    return result_gpu

def gravitate_gpu(grid_gpu, direction_gpu):
    """GPU-accelerated gravitate"""
    # Iterative kernel on GPU (42 iterations)
    return result_gpu
```

#### Step 3: Register GPU Operations

Update `gpu_env.py` to register GPU operations:

```python
def _register_gpu_operations(self):
    """Register available GPU operations"""
    from dsl_gpu import o_g_gpu, fgpartition_gpu, gravitate_gpu
    
    self.gpu_ops = {
        'o_g': o_g_gpu,
        'fgpartition': fgpartition_gpu,
        'gravitate': gravitate_gpu,
        # Add more as profiling identifies them
    }
```

#### Step 4: Test and Validate

```bash
# Test on slow solvers
python run_batt.py -i solve_36d67576

# Check GPU statistics
# Expected: 2-6x speedup for slow solvers
```

## üìä Expected Performance Impact

### Current State (Phase 1 Complete)
- Infrastructure: ‚úÖ Ready
- GPU operations: ‚ùå None registered
- **Actual speedup: 1x (no GPU operations yet)**

### After Phase 2 (GPU Operations Added)
- Heavy operations: ‚úÖ GPU-accelerated
- Light operations: ‚úÖ Stay on CPU (automatic)
- **Expected speedup: 2-6x for slow solvers**

### Target Solvers (from benchmark_solvers.py)

| Solver | CPU Time | Expected GPU Time | Speedup |
|--------|----------|-------------------|---------|
| solve_36d67576 | 120.7ms | 20-40ms | 3-6x |
| solve_36fdfd69 | 58.3ms | 12-19ms | 3-5x |
| solve_1a07d186 | 11.0ms | 4-5ms | 2.5x |
| solve_09629e4f | 6.4ms | 2.5-3ms | 2x |

### Overall Pipeline Impact

```
Full run_batt.py (320+ batt() calls):
- Current: ~100s
- Phase 2: ~30-50s (2-3x speedup)
- Phase 3 (batch): ~10s (10x speedup)
```

## üîç Monitoring GPU Usage

Check if GPU operations are being used:

```python
# At end of batt() execution
env.print_stats()

# Example output:
# === GPU Execution Statistics ===
# Total operations: 456
# GPU operations: 12 (2.6%)  ‚Üê Should increase after Phase 2
# CPU operations: 444 (97.4%)
# GPU errors: 0
#
# Timing:
# GPU time: 15.23ms
# CPU time: 102.45ms
# Total time: 117.68ms
#
# Transfers:
# CPU‚ÜíGPU: 3
# GPU‚ÜíCPU: 1
# GPU cached: 8
# =================================
```

## üí° Quick Wins Available

1. **Profile First** - Don't guess which operations are slow
   ```bash
   python profile_solvers.py  # Takes 5 minutes, saves hours
   ```

2. **Start Small** - GPU-accelerate 1 operation first
   - Validate the infrastructure works
   - Learn CuPy patterns
   - Build confidence before scaling

3. **Use Existing Batch Processing** - Already implemented!
   ```python
   from gpu_optimizations import auto_select_optimizer
   optimizer = auto_select_optimizer()
   # 10-35x speedup validated on Kaggle
   ```
