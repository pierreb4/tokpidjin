# GPU Solver Analysis - Archived Documentation (2025-10-10)

This directory contains intermediate analysis files created during the discovery process that led to the GPU solver acceleration strategy. These files have been consolidated into the comprehensive **GPU_SOLVER_STRATEGY.md** in the root directory.

## Archived Files

### Initial Analysis
- **SOLVER_GPU_ANALYSIS.md** - First analysis showing why solver functions are better GPU targets than individual DSL operations
- **P_G_PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS.md** - Analysis of p_g GPU failure (3x slower than CPU)
- **GPU_REALITY_CHECK.md** - Why individual DSL operations don't work on GPU

### Benchmark Results
- **SOLVER_BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md** - Detailed analysis of 28 solver benchmarks showing 120ms and 58ms execution times

### Strategy Documents
- **GPU_STRATEGY_PIVOT.md** - Explanation of why we pivoted from DSL operations to solver functions

## Current Active Documentation

All information from these files has been consolidated into:
- **GPU_SOLVER_STRATEGY.md** - Comprehensive strategy for GPU-accelerating solver functions

## Key Findings (Now in GPU_SOLVER_STRATEGY.md)

1. ✅ Individual DSL operations are too fast for GPU (0.1-0.5ms)
2. ✅ Solver functions are perfect GPU targets (1-120ms execution time)
3. ✅ Found 2 excellent candidates: solve_36d67576 (120ms) and solve_36fdfd69 (58ms)
4. ✅ Expected speedup: 2-6x for complex solvers
5. ✅ GPU overhead (0.2ms) becomes negligible for long solvers

## Why Archived

These files were created during rapid iteration and exploration. The key insights have been:
- Consolidated into a single comprehensive strategy document
- Updated with latest benchmark results
- Organized into a clear implementation plan

Keeping these for historical reference and to show the discovery process.
