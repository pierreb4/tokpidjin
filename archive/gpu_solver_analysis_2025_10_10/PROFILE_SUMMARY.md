# Profile Results Summary - CRITICAL DISCOVERY! ðŸŽ¯

**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… **Single bottleneck identified - ready to implement**

## ðŸ”¥ The Discovery

**ONE operation dominates everything: `o_g` (connected components)**

## By The Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Time consumed by o_g** | 75-92% of solver execution |
| **Average o_g time** | 4.0-7.5 ms per call |
| **Expected GPU time** | 0.8-1.5 ms per call |
| **Expected speedup** | **3-6x** |
| **Solver speedup** | **2.7x average** |
| **ARC evaluation savings** | **0.5-1.75 seconds** |

## What We Found

### 3 Solvers Profiled Successfully

```
solve_23b5c85d (8.2ms):  o_g = 7.5ms (92%)
solve_09629e4f (6.8ms):  o_g = 5.6ms (82%)
solve_1f85a75f (5.4ms):  o_g = 4.0ms (75%)
```

All other operations combined: <2ms (insignificant)

### 5 Solvers Failed to Profile

Likely due to profiling overhead causing timeouts. Not critical - we have enough data.

## The Bottleneck: `o_g`

**What it does**: Connected components (flood-fill algorithm)

**Why it's slow**:
- Nested loops over entire grid
- Flood-fill for each component
- Calls helper functions 490-1100 times
- Pure Python, no vectorization

**Why it's perfect for GPU**:
- Complex iterative algorithm
- High arithmetic intensity
- Long execution time (4-7ms)
- GPU overhead (0.2ms) becomes negligible (3-5%)

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1: GPU o_g
Use CuPy's `cupyx.scipy.ndimage.label` for connected components

**Expected result**:
- o_g: 4-7ms â†’ 0.8-1.5ms (3-6x speedup)
- Solvers: 5-8ms â†’ 2-3ms (2.7x average speedup)

### Week 2: GPU-Resident Solvers
Convert profiled solvers to run entirely on GPU

**Expected result**:
- solve_23b5c85d: 8.2ms â†’ 2.2ms (3.7x)
- solve_09629e4f: 6.8ms â†’ 2.6ms (2.6x)
- solve_1f85a75f: 5.4ms â†’ 2.4ms (2.3x)

### Week 3-4: Scale
Profile and GPU-accelerate more solvers

**Expected result**:
- 10-20 GPU-accelerated solvers
- 0.5-1.75 seconds saved in ARC evaluation

## Files Created

2. **GPU_O_G_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** - Complete implementation plan for GPU o_g

## Next Action

**Implement GPU o_g using CuPy** - See GPU_O_G_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

**The path is clear: GPU-accelerate o_g, get 3-6x speedup! ðŸš€**
