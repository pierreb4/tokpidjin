# DSL Profiling - Session Summary

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Session Goal**: Profile DSL operations to identify GPU acceleration targets  
**Status**: ✅ Profiling tools ready for Kaggle deployment

## What We Accomplished

### 1. ✅ Understood the Real Bottleneck
- **Code generation**: 4s at 400 tasks (9% of time) - NOT the bottleneck
- **Solver execution**: 38.5s at 400 tasks (91% of time) - THE real bottleneck
- **Target**: GPU-accelerate DSL operations within solvers, not batch grid processing

### 2. ✅ Created Profiling Tools

**profile_batt_dsl.py** (229 lines)
- Single-task DSL function profiler
- Shows per-function call counts, times, percentages
- Provides GPU priority recommendations (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Works with any generated batt file

**profile_batt_batch.py** (274 lines)
- Multi-task aggregate profiler
- Processes 20-400 tasks, aggregates statistics
- Identifies consistent bottlenecks across tasks
- Calculates expected GPU speedup impact
- Saves results to JSON for analysis

### 3. ✅ Documented Profiling Workflow

**PROFILING_README.md** (comprehensive guide)
- Why local profiling doesn't work (threading/no GPU)
- How to profile on Kaggle (step-by-step)
- Expected results based on GPU_SOLVER_STRATEGY.md
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Implementation priorities

**Updated .github/copilot-instructions.md**
- Added profiling workflow section
- Clarified local vs Kaggle development cycle
- Documented "Profile on Kaggle, not locally" rule

### 4. ✅ Committed and Pushed to Repo

**Commit**: `a059473d`
- All profiling tools
- Documentation updates
- Ready for Kaggle deployment

## Key Insights

### Why Local Profiling Failed
```
Local laptop issues:
- Threading/multiprocessing in run_batt.py obscures DSL function times
- No GPU to test actual GPU code paths  
- Different execution model than production

Result: 28.5s total execution, but "No significant DSL calls detected"
```

### Why Kaggle Profiling Will Work
```
Kaggle advantages:
- Real GPU environment (T4x2, P100, L4x4)
- Production batt functions with real solvers
- Accurate timing without threading interference
- Can test GPU code paths immediately

Expected result: o_g/objects 15-30%, clear bottlenecks identified
```

## Expected Results from Kaggle

Based on GPU_SOLVER_STRATEGY.md and existing benchmarks:

### HIGH PRIORITY (>10% execution time)
- **o_g** / **objects**: 15-30% of execution time
  - Expected GPU speedup: 3-6x
  - Impact: Major speedup on complex solvers

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (5-10% execution time)
- **fgpartition** / **partition**: 5-15% of execution time
- **gravitate**: 3-10% of execution time
  - Expected GPU speedup: 2-4x each
  - Impact: Complementary to o_g acceleration

### LOW PRIORITY (1-5% execution time)
- Various other DSL operations
- Implement after HIGH/MEDIUM complete

### Overall Impact Projection
```
Current: 38.5s solver execution at 400 tasks
After GPU:
  - HIGH priority (3-6x): 50% faster → 19-25s
  - MEDIUM priority (2-4x): 25% faster → 15-19s
  - Total speedup: 2-2.5x → 15-19s

With code gen (4s): 19-23s total vs 42.5s baseline
Overall pipeline speedup: 1.8-2.2x
```

## Next Steps (Kaggle Workflow)

### Step 1: Deploy to Kaggle ⏳
```python
# Upload these files:
- profile_batt_dsl.py
- profile_batt_batch.py  
- tmp_batt_onerun_run.py (or other generated batt)

# Enable GPU: Settings → Accelerator → GPU T4 x2
```

### Step 2: Run Profiler ⏳
```bash
# In Kaggle notebook:
!python profile_batt_batch.py -f tmp_batt_onerun_run -n 100 -o results.json

# Download results.json
# Analyze HIGH/MEDIUM priority functions
```

### Step 3: Implement GPU Operations ⏳
```python
# For top bottleneck (likely o_g):
1. Check if gpu_o_g exists in dsl.py
2. Implement hybrid approach:
   - Arrays/tuples on GPU for computation
   - Convert to frozenset at function boundaries
3. Add CPU fallback for small inputs
4. Test on Kaggle with GPU enabled
5. Measure actual vs expected speedup
```

### Step 4: Iterate ⏳
```python
# Re-run profiler with GPU ops enabled
# Implement #2 and #3 bottlenecks
# Target: 2-4x overall solver speedup
# Final: 38.5s → 10-15s for 400 tasks
```

## Command Reference

### Generate batt function
```bash
python card.py -c 1 -f test_batt.py --task 007bbfb7
```

### Profile single task (local test only)
```bash
python profile_batt_dsl.py -f test_batt -t 007bbfb7
```

### Profile multiple tasks (Kaggle)
```bash
python profile_batt_batch.py -f tmp_batt_onerun_run -n 100 -o results.json
```

### Analyze results
```python
import json
with open('results.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

# See recommendations
for rec in data['aggregate']['recommendations']:
    if rec['gpu_priority'] == 'HIGH':
        print(f"{rec['function']}: {rec['percent_of_total']:.1f}%")
