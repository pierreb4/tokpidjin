# Phase 3: GPU Acceleration Activation

**Status**: Ready to Start  
**Previous**: Phase 2b infrastructure deployed and validated  
**Current**: GPU infrastructure ready, awaiting acceleration activation  
**Target**: 2-3x speedup on solver execution (12-15s wall-clock for 100 tasks)  

## Quick Summary

Phase 2b successfully deployed GPU infrastructure on Kaggle. The batch processor is working, batch accumulation is happening, and the pipeline is stable. However, we're not yet executing GPU operations on the accumulated solver grids.

**Current state**: 24.813s for 100 tasks (same as Phase 2a baseline)  
**Target state**: 12-15s for 100 tasks (2x improvement)  
**Missing piece**: Activate GPU operations on batch solver grids

## Phase 3 Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Identify GPU Operation Opportunities

**Where GPU can help:**
- DSL operations within solver execution (p_g, rot90, flip, transpose, shift)
- Batch of 100+ solver grids accumulated during evolution
- Natural batch boundaries observed during solver runs

**Current pipeline:**
```
For each task:
  ├─ Generate initial candidates
  ├─ For each generation:
  │  ├─ Accumulate solver grids in batch_accumulator
  │  ├─ When batch full (100+): Process on GPU
  │  └─ Return results to solver pipeline
  └─ Output best solvers
```

### Step 2: Activate GPU Operations

**Current code (non-accelerating):**
```python
# gpu_batch_solver.py - currently just returns batch as-is
def process_batch(self, grids, operation='passthrough'):
    if not self.use_gpu:
        return grids  # CPU fallback
    try:
        # GPU operations happen here
        batch_gpu = [cp.asarray(grid) for grid in grids]
        # ... operations ...
        return [cp.asnumpy(g) for g in results_gpu]
    except Exception:
        return grids  # CPU fallback
```

**Next steps:**
1. Implement actual GPU operations in `process_batch()`
2. Map DSL operations to GPU equivalents (p_g → CuPy array operations)
3. Verify correctness with small tests first
4. Deploy to Kaggle and measure speedup

### Step 3: Measure GPU Impact

**Expected results:**
- Batch of 100 grids: ~100ms on GPU vs ~1000ms on CPU = 10x per operation
- With 5-10 DSL calls per solver: 2-3x overall speedup expected
- Wall-clock: 24.813s → 12-15s for 100 tasks

**Validation sequence:**
```bash
# 1. Small test (1-5 tasks) - verify speedup
python run_batt.py -c 5 --timing

# 2. Medium test (32 tasks) - measure real impact
python run_batt.py -c 32 --timing

# 3. Full validation (100 tasks) - confirm improvement
python run_batt.py -c 100 --timing
```

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 3a: GPU Operation Integration (2-3 hours)

**Files to modify:**
1. `gpu_batch_solver.py` - Implement actual GPU operations
2. `gpu_batch_integration.py` - Ensure proper data flow
3. `run_batt.py` - Configure GPU parameters (optional)

**Operations to GPU-accelerate (priority order):**
1. **p_g()** - Pattern matching (most frequent)
2. **rot90()** - Rotation (common)
3. **flip()** - Flipping (common)
4. **transpose()** - Transpose (common)
5. **shift()** - Shifting (common)

### Phase 3b: Local Testing (1 hour)

**Validation before Kaggle:**
```bash
# CPU-only test (ensure no regression)
python gpu_batch_solver.py --test-local

# Verify GPU operations (if CuPy available locally)
python gpu_batch_solver.py --test-gpu
```

### Phase 3c: Kaggle Validation (2-3 hours)

**Staged rollout:**
1. 1-5 tasks: Quick verification
2. 32 tasks: Measure speedup
3. 100 tasks: Full validation

**Success criteria:**
- ✅ 2-3x speedup observed
- ✅ Correctness maintained (100%)
- ✅ Wall-clock ≤ 15s for 100 tasks
- ✅ 0 errors

## Key Considerations

### GPU Memory Management

```
Per batch (100 grids, max 30×30):
- Input grids: 100 × 900 × 4 bytes = 360KB
- Working memory: ~10MB
- Total: ~10.7MB (well within 14.7GB per GPU)

Safe to increase batch size further if needed.
```

### Correctness Verification

- Must match Phase 2a output exactly
- GPU operations must be deterministic
- Test on small batch first before scaling

### Error Handling

```python
# Always include CPU fallback
try:
    result = gpu_operation(batch)
except Exception:
    result = [cpu_operation(grid) for grid in batch]
    log_error(...)
```

## Expected Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Phase 3a: GPU Integration | 2-3 hours | Ready to start |
| Phase 3b: Local Testing | 1 hour | Follow 3a |
| Phase 3c: Kaggle Validation | 2-3 hours | Follow 3b |
| **Total** | **5-7 hours** | **Complete by end of day** |

## Success Metrics

```
100-task run:
  Wall-clock: 24.813s
  Solvers: 13,200
  Errors: 0
  Cache hit: 100% inlining, 18% validation
```

### After Phase 3 (Target)

```
100-task run:
  Wall-clock: 12-15s (2x improvement)
  Solvers: 13,200 (same)
  Errors: 0 (same)
  Cache hit: Maintained (+ GPU acceleration)
```

### Combined Optimization (All Phases)

```
From original baseline:
  Phase 1b: -4.7% (type hints, lambdas, set comprehension)
  Phase 2a: +0% wall-clock (cache hits amortized)
  Phase 2b: -50% to -60% (GPU acceleration)
  ────────────────────────────────────
  Total: -54% to -64% from original baseline
```

## Next Action

**Ready to proceed with Phase 3 GPU acceleration activation?**

When you're ready:
1. Review `gpu_batch_solver.py` current implementation
2. Identify which DSL operations to GPU-accelerate first
3. Implement GPU operations in `process_batch()`
4. Test locally
5. Deploy to Kaggle and measure speedup

Expected completion: By end of today if started now ⏱️
