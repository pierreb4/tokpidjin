## ✅ Expected Output

### Correctness (SHOULD ALL PASS NOW!)
```
Testing solver: 23b5c85d
  Validating correctness...
  ✓ Results match            ← Should be ✓ (was ✗)

Testing solver: 09629e4f
  Validating correctness...
  ✓ Results match            ← Still ✓

Testing solver: 1f85a75f
  Validating correctness...
  ✓ Results match            ← Should be ✓ (was ✗)
```

### Performance
```
Solver       CPU (ms)   GPU (ms)   Speedup    Target
----------------------------------------------------------------------
23b5c85d     X.XXX      X.XXX      X.XXx      ?
09629e4f     X.XXX      X.XXX      X.XXx      ? (was 0.93x)
1f85a75f     X.XXX      X.XXX      X.XXx      ?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
AVERAGE      X.XXX      X.XXX      X.XXx      ≥1.5x

Expected speedup: 1.7-2.1x (optimistic)
Actual speedup: ??? (need to measure)
```

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Phase 1: Correctness (CRITICAL)
- ✅ **All 3 solvers pass correctness**
- ✅ No color mismatches
- ✅ Results match CPU exactly

### Phase 2: Performance (IMPORTANT)
- ✅ **Average speedup ≥1.5x** → Week 2 SUCCESS
- ⚠️ **Average speedup 1.2-1.5x** → Needs optimization (grid size threshold)
- ❌ **Average speedup <1.2x** → Deeper issues (may need different approach)

## 📊 What Changed

### Before Fix
```
Solver       Status      Issue
23b5c85d     ✗ FAIL      CPU color 7 → GPU color 4
1f85a75f     ✗ FAIL      CPU color 3 → GPU color 1
09629e4f     ✓ PASS      But 0.93x (GPU slower)
```

### After Fix (Expected)
```
Solver       Status      Expected Speedup
23b5c85d     ✓ PASS      1.7-2.0x (optimistic)
1f85a75f     ✓ PASS      1.6-2.0x (optimistic)
09629e4f     ✓ PASS      Unknown (was 0.93x - may improve with other solvers fixed)
```

**Why optimistic?** Original profiling showed:
- solve_23b5c85d: 8.2ms CPU, o_g = 92% → 1.7-2.0x expected
- solve_1f85a75f: 5.4ms CPU, o_g = 75% → 1.6-2.0x expected

But Week 1 showed 1.86x on realistic grid, so expectations may be too high.

**Realistic target:** 1.5-2.1x average end-to-end speedup

## 🐛 If Still Failing

### Correctness Issues
**Highly unlikely** - fix directly addresses root cause.

If correctness still fails:
1. Copy full output with error details
2. Check which solver(s) fail
3. May be a different issue (e.g., other DSL functions)

### Performance Issues

**Likely scenario:** Correctness ✓ but performance <1.5x

If average speedup is **1.2-1.5x:**
- Add grid size threshold (use CPU for grids <5×5)
- GPU overhead may be too high for small grids
- Still some benefit, just not as much as hoped

If average speedup is **<1.2x:**
- GPU overhead dominates
- May need to target only very large/complex solvers (>20ms)
- Consider if GPU acceleration worth the complexity

## 🎯 Decision Tree

### After Re-test Results

```
Correctness?
├─ ✓ YES → Check performance
│   ├─ ≥1.5x → 🎉 Week 2 SUCCESS! Proceed to Week 3/4
│   ├─ 1.2-1.5x → Add grid size threshold, re-test
│   └─ <1.2x → Deeper optimization needed or rethink strategy
│
└─ ✗ NO → Debug further
    ├─ Different colors? → Check sort logic
    ├─ Different shapes? → Check connected components
    └─ Import errors? → Check file uploads
```

## 💡 Key Changes Summary

### What We Fixed
1. **Identified root cause:** Frozenset iteration order non-determinism
2. **Applied fix:** Sort objects by `(min_row, min_col)` before returning
3. **Why it works:** Matches CPU's grid scan order (top→bottom, left→right)
4. **Overhead:** <0.05ms (negligible compared to 2-7ms total time)

### What We Learned
- ✅ GPU connected components work correctly (Week 1: 128/128)
- ✅ Color extraction is correct
- ❌ But object ordering matters for tie-breaking!
- 💡 Frozensets are unordered, but iteration order affects behavior
