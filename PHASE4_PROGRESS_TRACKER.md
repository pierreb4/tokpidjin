## Optimization Sequence

### Quick Win #1: Inlining Cache Expansion
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - Testing Phase  
**Target**: 3-8% speedup  
**Implementation**: Cache final inlined solver bodies to avoid re-inlining  
**Estimated time**: 1-2 hours

**What We Built**:
- `solver_body_cache.py` (150 lines) - Complete cache infrastructure
- Modified `run_batt.py` to initialize cache on startup
- **Integrated cache into `inline_one()` function**:
  - Check cache before calling `cached_inline_variables()`
  - Store successful inlining results for future reuse
  - Disk-backed + in-memory cache for persistence across runs
- `test_quick_win_1.py` - Unit tests (all passing ✓)
- `validate_quick_win_1.py` - Performance validation script

**Checkpoint**: 
- Date: Oct 17, 2025 (implementation complete)
- Unit tests: ✅ PASSED (4/4 tests)
- Integration: ✅ COMPLETE (inline_one() modified)
- Wall-clock: (pending - needs validation run)
- Speedup: (pending - needs 5-10 task validation)
- Result: (pending)

## Performance Tracking

### After Each Optimization

Record here as optimizations are implemented:

```
Format:
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM: Quick Win #X - [Description]
  Before: Xs  After: Xs  Speedup: (X-Y)/X = Z%  Cumulative: Xs / (X/24.813) speedup
  Status: ✅ (if successful) or ❌ (if reverted)
  Notes: [Any issues, side effects, or insights]
```

## Cumulative Progress

**Phase 2a**: -4.7% (type safety, already applied)  
**Phase 2b**: 100% inlining cache (already applied)  

**Phase 4 Cumulative**:
- After Quick Win #1: (pending)
- After Quick Win #2: (pending)
- After Quick Win #3: (pending)
- After Quick Win #4: (pending)
- After Quick Win #5: (pending)

**Total optimization from baseline (42.5s)**:
- Current: 24.813s (41.6% optimization)
- Target after Phase 4: 12-14s (70-72% optimization) ✅

## Testing Checklist

### For Each Optimization

- [ ] Local single-task test (correctness)
- [ ] Local 10-task test (performance)
- [ ] Record baseline time before implementation
- [ ] Record optimized time after implementation
- [ ] Calculate speedup percentage
- [ ] Update progress tracker
- [ ] Commit with measured results

### Final Validation

- [ ] Run 100-task test on Kaggle
- [ ] Verify 0 errors, all 13,200 solvers correct
- [ ] Measure total wall-clock time
- [ ] Calculate overall Phase 4 speedup
- [ ] Document in PHASE4_RESULTS.md

## Key Insights

1. **Small improvements compound**: Even 5% per optimization × 5 optimizations = 22% total
2. **Measure everything**: Verify speedup for each optimization
3. **Reversibility**: Can revert any optimization if it causes issues
4. **Early exit**: Profile-guided optimization is working (we know where 74% is spent)
5. **Low-hanging fruit**: Cache improvements are safest and highest ROI

## Success Looks Like

### Intermediate Success (after 2-3 quick wins)
- Combined speedup: ~1.2x (from 24.8s to ~20s)
- Confidence: High that approach is working
- Next: Continue with remaining optimizations

### Full Success (after all 5 quick wins)
- Combined speedup: 1.8-2.7x (to 12-14s)
- Overall optimization: 70-72% from baseline
- Status: Phase 4 complete, optimization goal achieved

### Validation Success
- Kaggle 100-task: 12-14s confirmed
- Correctness: 0 errors, 13,200 solvers
- All optimizations hold under production load
