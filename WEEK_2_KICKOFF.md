**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Status:** Week 1 COMPLETE ‚Üí Week 2 STARTING

## üìä Week 1 Final Results

### Correctness ‚úÖ
- **Tests passed:** 128/128 (100%)
- **All modes working:** 0-7 ‚úì
- **Edge cases handled:** Empty, single cell, patterns ‚úì
- **Verdict:** Production-ready correctness

### Performance ‚ö†Ô∏è Mixed Results

#### Small Test Grids (3√ó3, 5√ó5)
```
Mode   CPU (ms)   GPU (ms)   Speedup
----   --------   --------   -------
AVG    0.826      1.943      0.43x   ‚ö†Ô∏è
```
**Issue:** GPU overhead (0.5-1ms) dominates tiny grids

#### Realistic Grid (10√ó10) ‚úÖ
```
Integration Test:
  CPU:              2.771 ms
  GPU (frozenset):  1.486 ms  (1.86x speedup) ‚úì
  GPU (tuple):      1.476 ms  (1.88x speedup) ‚úì
```
**Result:** Approaching target on realistic workloads

### Key Learnings

1. **Test grids were too small** (3√ó3, 5√ó5)
2. **GPU overhead is ~0.5-1ms** (warmup + transfer)
3. **Larger grids benefit more** (10√ó10 shows 1.86x)
4. **Profiled solvers use 4-7ms grids** (larger than test grids)
5. **Integration test is more representative** than micro-benchmarks

### Performance Fix Applied
- **Before:** 0.27x (per-element GPU‚ÜíCPU transfers)
- **After:** 1.86x on realistic grid (bulk transfers)
- **Improvement:** 7x better!

### Adjusted Expectations

**Original:** 2.3-7.8x speedup  
**Revised:** 1.5-2.5x end-to-end solver speedup  

**Rationale:**
- GPU overhead is higher than expected (0.5-1ms vs 0.2ms)
- o_g is 75-92% of solver time, not 100%
- Other solver operations add overhead
- More realistic for production use

## üöÄ Week 2 Plan: Solver Integration

### Goal
Integrate `gpu_o_g` into 3 profiled solvers and measure **end-to-end performance**.

### Target Solvers (From Profiling)

| Solver | CPU Time | o_g % | o_g Time | Expected GPU Time | Expected Speedup |
|--------|----------|-------|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| solve_23b5c85d | 8.2ms | 92% | 7.5ms | ~4ms | 1.7-2.0x |
| solve_09629e4f | 6.8ms | 82% | 5.6ms | ~3ms | 1.8-2.3x |
| solve_1f85a75f | 5.4ms | 75% | 4.0ms | ~2.2ms | 1.6-2.0x |

**Average Expected:** 1.7-2.1x end-to-end speedup

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Locate Solvers
```bash
grep -n "def solve_23b5c85d\|def solve_09629e4f\|def solve_1f85a75f" solvers_pre.py
```

#### Step 2: Create GPU Versions
Create `gpu_solvers_pre.py` with GPU-accelerated versions:
```python
from gpu_dsl_core import gpu_o_g
from dsl import *  # Import other DSL functions

def gpu_solve_23b5c85d(inputs):
    # Replace: o_g(...) ‚Üí gpu_o_g(...)
    # Keep everything else the same
    ...
```

#### Step 3: Benchmark
```python
# Test both versions
cpu_time = benchmark(solve_23b5c85d, test_inputs)
gpu_time = benchmark(gpu_solve_23b5c85d, test_inputs)
speedup = cpu_time / gpu_time
```

#### Step 4: Validate Correctness
```python
# Results must match exactly
cpu_result = solve_23b5c85d(inputs)
gpu_result = gpu_solve_23b5c85d(inputs)
assert cpu_result == gpu_result
```

### Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Correctness:** 100% match with CPU versions  
‚úÖ **Performance:** ‚â•1.5x average end-to-end speedup  
‚úÖ **Consistency:** All 3 solvers show improvement  

### Risk Mitigation

If speedup < 1.5x:
1. Add grid size threshold (use CPU for small grids)
2. Profile to find remaining bottlenecks
3. Consider GPU-resident approach (Week 3 early)

If correctness issues:
1. Debug with verbose logging
2. Compare intermediate results
3. Test with more diverse inputs
