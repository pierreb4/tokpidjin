# Profile Results: DSL Operations in Solver Functions

**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Source**: Kaggle L4 GPU profiling of solver functions  
**Status**: ‚úÖ CRITICAL INSIGHTS DISCOVERED

## Executive Summary

**MAJOR DISCOVERY**: `o_g` (objects/connected components) dominates execution time, consuming **75-92% of total solver runtime**. This single operation is the primary GPU acceleration target!

### Top Finding: o_g Is THE Bottleneck

| Solver | Total Time | o_g Time | o_g % | o_g Avg/Call |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|--------------|
| solve_23b5c85d | 8.2 ms | 74.9 ms | 918% | **7.5 ms** |
| solve_09629e4f | 6.8 ms | 55.6 ms | 818% | **5.6 ms** |
| solve_1f85a75f | 5.4 ms | 40.0 ms | 747% | **4.0 ms** |

**Note**: Percentages >100% because `o_g` is called 10 times (warmup + benchmark iterations)

- `get_arg_rank_f` is secondary (0.8ms per call)
- `subgrid` is tertiary (0.5ms per call)

## Critical Analysis: Why o_g Dominates

### o_g Implementation Pattern
`o_g` (objects/connected components) calls several helper functions:
1. **objects** - Main connected components algorithm
2. **neighbors** - Get adjacent cells (called 49-110x per o_g call)
3. **ineighbors** - Interior neighbors (called 49-110x)
4. **dneighbors** - Diagonal neighbors (called 49-110x)

### Execution Breakdown for solve_23b5c85d
```
Total o_g time:     74.9 ms (100%)
‚îú‚îÄ objects:         74.5 ms (99.5%) ‚Üê Main algorithm
‚îú‚îÄ neighbors:       67.5 ms (90%)  ‚Üê Called by objects
‚îú‚îÄ dneighbors:      21.9 ms (29%)  ‚Üê Called by objects
‚îî‚îÄ ineighbors:      21.8 ms (29%)  ‚Üê Called by objects

(Total > 100% because of nested calls)
```

**Insight**: `o_g` is a **complex iterative algorithm** that:
- Scans entire grid multiple times
- Builds connected components via flood-fill
- Uses recursion/iteration (hundreds of helper calls)
- Perfect for GPU parallelization!

## GPU Acceleration Priority List

### Priority 1: o_g (CRITICAL - 75-92% of time)
```
Average time: 4.0-7.5 ms per call
Total impact: 40-75 ms per solver execution
GPU viability: ‚úÖ‚úÖ EXCELLENT
Reason: Complex iterative algorithm, high arithmetic intensity
Expected speedup: 3-5x (4-7ms ‚Üí 1-2ms)
```

**Implementation approach**:
- GPU-accelerated connected components algorithm
- Keep entire grid on GPU during flood-fill
- Parallel BFS/DFS for component discovery
- CuPy connected components or custom CUDA kernel

### Priority 2: get_arg_rank / get_arg_rank_f (10-15% of time)
```
Average time: 0.5-0.8 ms per call
GPU viability: ‚ö†Ô∏è  MAYBE
Reason: Borderline execution time, sorting/ranking operation
Expected speedup: 1.5-2x (if batched)
```

### Priority 3: subgrid (5-10% of time)
```
Average time: 0.5 ms per call
GPU viability: ‚ö†Ô∏è  MAYBE
Reason: Simple array slicing, GPU overhead might dominate
Expected speedup: 1.2-1.5x (marginal)
```

### ‚ùå NOT Worth GPU Acceleration
- `neighbors`, `ineighbors`, `dneighbors` - Too simple (0.02-0.06ms each)
- `shift`, `paint`, `fill` - Too fast (<0.2ms each)
- Most other operations - <0.1ms per call

## Why 3 Solvers Failed to Profile

**Failed solvers**:
- solve_36d67576 (expected 120ms)
- solve_36fdfd69 (expected 58ms)
- solve_1a07d186 (expected 11ms)
- solve_272f95fa (expected 8ms)
- solve_29623171 (expected 5ms)

**Likely reasons**:
1. **Timeout** - Profiling overhead made execution too slow
2. **Error in solver** - Some dependency not available
3. **Data issue** - Required input data not in first sample

**Impact**: Not critical - we have enough data from successful profiles

## Projected GPU Acceleration Impact

### If We GPU-Accelerate o_g Only

**Assumptions**:
- o_g: 4-7ms CPU ‚Üí 1-2ms GPU (3-5x speedup)
- Other operations stay on CPU (too fast for GPU)

**Impact on Profiled Solvers**:

#### solve_23b5c85d
```
Current:  8.2 ms total, 7.5ms o_g
GPU:      8.2 - 7.5 + 1.9 = 2.6 ms
Speedup:  3.2x
Savings:  5.6 ms per call
```

#### solve_09629e4f
```
Current:  6.8 ms total, 5.6ms o_g
GPU:      6.8 - 5.6 + 1.4 = 2.6 ms
Speedup:  2.6x
Savings:  4.2 ms per call
```

#### solve_1f85a75f
```
Current:  5.4 ms total, 4.0ms o_g
GPU:      5.4 - 4.0 + 1.0 = 2.4 ms
Speedup:  2.3x
Savings:  3.0 ms per call
```

**Average speedup**: **2.7x** just from GPU-accelerating o_g!

### Extrapolation to All Solvers

**Conservative estimate**:
- 100 tasks in ARC evaluation
- 30% use solvers with o_g (30 tasks)
- Average solver: 6ms ‚Üí 2.4ms (2.5x speedup)
- Called 5 times per task

**Total savings**: 30 tasks √ó 5 calls √ó 3.6ms = **540ms** (half a second!)

**Optimistic estimate**:
- 50% of tasks use o_g (50 tasks)
- Average solver: 8ms ‚Üí 3ms (2.7x speedup)
- Called 7 times per task

**Total savings**: 50 tasks √ó 7 calls √ó 5ms = **1.75 seconds**

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Implement GPU o_g (Week 1)
**Goal**: GPU-accelerated connected components algorithm

**Approach**:
```python
def gpu_o_g(grid_gpu, color):
    """
    GPU-accelerated connected components.
    
    Current CPU: 4-7ms per call
    Target GPU:  1-2ms per call (3-5x speedup)
    
    Strategy:
    - Use CuPy connected components (scipy.ndimage.label equivalent)
    - OR implement custom CUDA kernel for flood-fill
    - Keep all intermediate results on GPU
    - Convert frozenset results at the end
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

**Success criteria**:
- 100% correctness (matches CPU exactly)
- >2.5x speedup (4-7ms ‚Üí <2ms)
- Works on all test grids

### Phase 2: GPU-Resident Solvers (Week 2)
**Goal**: Convert solvers to run entirely on GPU

**Target solvers**:

- solve_1f85a75f (5.4ms ‚Üí 2.4ms, 2.3x speedup)

**Implementation**:
```python
def solve_23b5c85d_gpu(S, I_cpu, C):
    # Transfer to GPU once
    I_gpu = cp.asarray(I_cpu)
    
    # All operations on GPU
    x1_gpu = gpu_o_g(I_gpu, R5)
    x2_gpu = gpu_get_arg_rank_f(x1_gpu, size, F0)
    x3_gpu = gpu_subgrid(x2_gpu, I_gpu)
    
    # Transfer to CPU once
    return cp.asnumpy(x3_gpu)
```

### Phase 3: Scale & Optimize (Week 3-4)
