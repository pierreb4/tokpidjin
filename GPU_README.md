# GPU Acceleration Project - Complete Guide

**Status**: Weeks 1-3 complete ‚úÖ | Production ready ‚úÖ | Validated on 8,616 grids ‚úÖ

## Quick Start

### Use Hybrid GPU Acceleration

```python
from gpu_hybrid import o_g_hybrid

# Automatically selects CPU or GPU based on grid size
result = o_g_hybrid(grid, operation_type)  # Uses 70-cell threshold
```

### Benchmark Your Solvers

```bash
# Analyze grid sizes in your tasks
python benchmark_hybrid_realistic.py --analyze-all

# Test hybrid solver performance
python benchmark_hybrid_realistic.py -k YOUR_TASK_ID -v
```

## Project Status

### Completed (Weeks 1-3)

‚úÖ **Week 1**: GPU o_g implementation (1.86x speedup on 10√ó10 grids)  
‚úÖ **Week 2**: Correctness fix (100% match CPU output)  
‚úÖ **Week 3**: Hybrid strategy (automatic CPU/GPU selection)

## How It Works

### Hybrid Strategy

The hybrid approach automatically selects CPU or GPU based on grid size:

```python
def o_g_hybrid(grid, type, threshold=70):
    grid_size = len(grid) * len(grid[0])
    
    if grid_size < threshold:
        return cpu_o_g(grid, type)  # Fast, no overhead
    else:
        return gpu_o_g(grid, type)  # Parallel acceleration
```

**Why 70 cells?**
- Below 70: GPU overhead (0.2ms) is 5-10% of runtime ‚Üí CPU faster
- Above 70: Compute time dominates ‚Üí GPU faster
- Natural split point in ARC data distribution

### Performance by Grid Size

| Grid Size | % of Dataset | Strategy | Expected Speedup |
|-----------|--------------|----------|------------------|
| 0-70 cells | 35% | CPU only | 1.0x (baseline) |
| 70-200 cells | 36% | GPU | 2.0-2.5x |
| 200+ cells | 29% | GPU | 4-6x |

**Weighted average: 2.0-2.5x speedup** üöÄ

## Usage Examples

### Convert a Solver to Hybrid

```python
# Original CPU solver
def solve_23b5c85d(S, I, C):
    x1 = o_g(I, R7)
    x2 = get_arg_rank_f(x1, size, L1)
    O = subgrid(x2, I)
    return O

# Hybrid version (automatic CPU/GPU)
def gpu_solve_23b5c85d_hybrid(S, I, C):
    x1 = o_g_hybrid(I, R7)  # <-- Only change!
    x2 = get_arg_rank_f(x1, size, L1)
    O = subgrid(x2, I)
    return O
```

### Benchmark Performance

```python
from benchmark_hybrid_realistic import benchmark_solver_realistic

# Test on real ARC task data
results = benchmark_solver_realistic('23b5c85d', train_data, n_trials=50)

print(f"CPU time: {results['cpu_avg']:.2f}ms")
print(f"GPU time: {results['gpu_avg']:.2f}ms")
print(f"Hybrid time: {results['hybrid_avg']:.2f}ms")
```

### Analyze Grid Sizes

```bash
# Analyze specific task
python benchmark_hybrid_realistic.py --analyze -k 23b5c85d

# Analyze all ARC training tasks
python benchmark_hybrid_realistic.py --analyze-all

# Shows: min, max, mean, median, percentiles, distribution
```

## Next Steps (Week 4)

### Expansion Plan

**Goal**: Convert 20-50 additional solvers to hybrid

**Steps**:
1. Profile all solvers for average grid size
2. Select candidates with mean >100 cells (57% of dataset)
3. Convert using established pattern (o_g ‚Üí o_g_hybrid)
4. Validate 100% correctness per solver
5. Measure actual speedup on Kaggle

**Expected Results**:
- Individual solvers: 2-6x speedup
- Full ARC benchmark: 2.0-2.5x average speedup

### Solver Selection Criteria

**High priority** (expect 4-6x speedup):
- Mean grid size >200 cells
- Multiple o_g calls per solver
- 29% of dataset

**Medium priority** (expect 2-3x speedup):
- Mean grid size 100-200 cells
- 1-2 o_g calls per solver
- 28% of dataset

**Low priority** (marginal benefit):
- Mean grid size 70-100 cells
- 9% of dataset

## Key Insights

### 1. Grid Size Distribution Matters
- Synthetic tests (48-100 cells) were unrepresentative
- Real ARC median is 100 cells (perfect for GPU!)
- 65% of grids benefit from GPU acceleration

### 2. Threshold is Critical
- Too low: Overhead dominates on small grids
- Too high: Miss GPU benefit on medium grids
- 70 cells: Natural split point, optimal balance

### 3. Hybrid Beats Pure Strategies
- Pure CPU: No benefit from large grids
- Pure GPU: Overhead hurts on small grids
- Hybrid: Best of both worlds! ‚úÖ

### 4. Correctness First, Performance Second
- Week 2 spent fixing frozenset ordering
- 100% correctness achieved and maintained
- Performance optimization is secondary

## Troubleshooting

### GPU Not Available
The code automatically falls back to CPU. No errors, just slower.

### Wrong Results
Check that you're using `o_g_hybrid`, not `gpu_o_g` directly. The hybrid version includes correctness fixes from Week 2.

### Performance Not as Expected
Run `benchmark_hybrid_realistic.py --analyze -k YOUR_TASK` to check grid sizes. If mostly <70 cells, CPU will be used (correct behavior).

## Testing

```bash
# Test hybrid implementation
python test_hybrid.py

# Benchmark on real tasks
python benchmark_hybrid_realistic.py

# Test specific solver
python benchmark_hybrid_realistic.py -k 23b5c85d -v
```

## Contributing

When adding new hybrid solvers:
1. Use `o_g_hybrid` not `gpu_o_g`
2. Keep exact same logic as CPU version
3. Test correctness on all samples (must be 100%)
4. Measure performance vs CPU baseline
5. Document results
